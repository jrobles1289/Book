<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">P</b>erhaps Taylor and his hand-picked team should have known by sheer intuition that when you are about to spend a half-million dollars of your employer’s money, you do not go spending it on a competitor’s product. After all, Ford employees do not drive Toyotas, and the soda machines at Pepsi headquarters do not get stocked with Coke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or perhaps, having almost all come from academia and government service, they were simply too green at working for an industrial enterprise to understand why Xerox’s computer company, SDS, would take amiss Taylor’s proposal that PARC purchase as its main computer a machine manufactured by its commercial archenemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially when the choice seemed to them a no-brainer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet that is what happened. As Taylor put it later, “We upset the apple cart and didn’t realize how badly.” Badly enough: PARC’s opening blunder would not be forgotten at Xerox headquarters for many years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Computer System Lab’s inaugural task of selecting the main computing hardware for all the PARC labs seemed straightforward enough from the standpoint of pure engineering. When the lab drew up the spec-97 ifications there was no need to hold a colloquium to weigh their options. There was only one: The PDP-10, manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Over the previous year the PDP-10 had taken the computing world by storm. One of DEC’s series of commercially successful units that had grown out of the artificial intelligence programs at MIT and Stanford, the PDP-10 was exceptional: A relatively compact computer (though it still took up a good-sized room) with time-sharing hardware that rapidly replaced the aging SDS 940s in scores of college computer centers and corporate back offices. The PDP-10 was so well designed that it is still treated with a cliquish reverence by computer jocks today, more than a decade after the last unit rolled off the factory line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The PDP-10 was also becoming the computer of choice—a  <i class="calibre6">de facto</i> standard—for research departments linked to the burgeoning ARPANET. It possessed the special virtue of having been specifically tailored to run Lisp, a popular programming language in which ARPANET researchers turned out software by the ream. Moreover, its operating system, Tenex, had been developed on an ARPA contract with government funds, and was thus available for anyone to use, free of charge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the mid-1970s, thanks to these features and others, computer science in the United States would cease to be a Babel of dozens of mutually incompatible machines. Instead, the prototypical computer research group would be a university department using PDP-10s equipped with the Tenex operating system and linked to the ARPANET. Even as early as 1971, it was hard to imagine a better description of CSL’s self-image. After all, Taylor was the ARPANET’s patriarch and they were almost all ARPANET “brats,” as they labeled themselves. To the Computer Science Lab it was almost an article of faith that PARC should be the PDP-10 node  <i class="calibre6">par excellence</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the lab was about to discover that purchasing capital equipment for a corporate facility could never be as straightforward a question of engineering as it might be for a faculty department at, say, MIT. For</p>
<p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre6">In 1979, ARPANET officials reported that of 202 host computers connected to the network, 104 were PDP-10s or their corporate relatives, PDP-11s.</i> when word got out that Bob Taylor was planning to install a DECcomputer at PARC, the executives at SDS went off like Roman candles. This was understandable. In 1971 SDS was fighting for its life, and DEC was its principal foe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after completing its purchase of SDS Xerox had discerned that all was not well at its new computer division. Max Palevsky, who had personally pocketed some $100 million from the billion-dollar transaction, was happier spending his money on Democratic campaigns and movie and magazine ventures (“I must be on every sucker list in town,” he said cheerily) than burying himself in the day-to-day problems of his old firm. Suspicion was rife that his real business talent resided in his knowing how to get out while the getting was good; popular rumor even had him confiding to aides about the SDS deal: “We sold them a dead horse before it hit the ground.” He denied the epigram, but acknowledged knowing that at the time of the sale SDS had entered a rocky stretch of the business cycle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As though to confirm everyone’s worst suspicions, SDS profits peaked in May 1969, at almost the very moment that ownership formally changed hands. That calendar year SDS recorded about $12 million in net income. The following year was its best ever in terms of sales—but for every dollar it recorded in revenue, it lost two. The division never again showed a profit. Over the following three years the losses would add up to nearly $120 million.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No later than early 1970, Rigdon Currie recalled, “the handwriting was on the wall.” At that time Currie, as head of sales, was instructed to prepare a detailed presentation on SDS prospects for a management meeting to be chaired by the choleric ex-West Pointer Dan McGurk, a former Palevsky lieutenant who had become the division’s president following the sale.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currie was a Georgia Tech-trained engineer whose southern courtliness masked a wicked sense of humor. He was determined to make sure his presentation would not easily be forgotten. On the appointed day he greeted the assembled executives while standing by a flip chart three feet tall. From the outset it was clear the news was not good. The condition of every one of the company’s leading customers was dire, he said. Govern- ment agencies like NASA and the National Science Foundation were sharply cutting their budgets. Time-sharing companies like Tymshare, which ran its nationwide network on SDS 940s, were encountering sales resistance at all levels. With the education, government, and aerospace industries all slumping simultaneously, nearly every market SDS served was on the rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, thanks to the PDP-10, SDS no longer found itself on the cutting edge of the time-sharing market, where it had been placed by the work of Project Genie. Even long-term customers turned in their leases on the SDS 940 once they got a look at the new DECmachine. That was an ominous trend. The old SDS leases were a fiscal time bomb: They permitted the customers to return their machines prior to expiration for a full pro-rata credit on the unexpired period. Unfortunately, SDS had long since recorded the full-term lease payments as revenue. This meant that as computers came back from failed or defecting clients SDS would have to recalculate the profits it had already reported for earlier quarters and quite possibly restate them—as losses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, taking all these factors together, where are we?” Currie asked out loud. He turned over the top card on his flip chart. The next one was blank except for two words in huge block letters:</p>
<p class="calibre2">“DEEP SHIT.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“McGurk almost killed me,” he remembered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Adding to the predicament of shrinking markets was Peter McColough’s determination to push SDS into a new one: the business data processing business ruled by IBM.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although McColough has been roundly chastised for this strategy, it may actually have originated with Max Palevsky. The SDS founder had always weighed his company against IBM as a benchmark. To outsiders this resembled weighing a puppy against a horse; no matter how big it grows, it can never play in the same league. Yet in the weeks following the Xerox sale Palevsky had openly fantasized about placing Xerox’s capital base behind the engineering skills of SDS and marching jointly into war against Big Blue. (Much later he hinted he was only telling McColough what the Xerox CEO wanted to hear.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the rest of the industry the act of stepping into IBM’s den seemed a fool’s errand. Big Blue did not always offer the most technologically advanced products in the market and frequently charged the highest prices, but the ruthlessness of its sales and marketing more than made up for these shortcomings (and fomented an epic battle with federal antitrust authorities). Companies that tried to dislodge IBMfrom its perch generally got butchered in the attempt. That had been the fate even of the industrial powerhouses General Electric and RCA, which had given up after losing a combined $600 million in ten years of trying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only major competitors left in the market were five large computer makers known familiarly as the “Bunch.” The term was an acronym of their names—Burroughs, (Sperry) Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell—but it was also descriptivè. The Bunch trailed IBM in a distant cluster, like a field of thoroughbreds struggling to keep up with Secretariat. From 1960 through 1970 the five competitors lost a combined $167 million while IBM racked up profits of more than $3.5  <i class="calibre6">billion</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Into this valley of death Peter McColough now proposed to ride SDS. The very notion all but proclaimed his ignorance of the computer industry in general and his own subsidiary in particular, for there could scarcely exist a company less qualified to take on this particular fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We did not have the tools to do it,” Robert Spinrad recalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bob Spinrad was an experienced scientist and engineer, unassertive but rigorously analytical. He was a gregarious gentleman of the old school, with a round face marked by eyebrows as dark and emphatic as exclamation points. Spinrad had joined SDS in 1968 to run its software group after several years at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the computer of choice was an SDS machine. Now he found himself swept unwillingly into McColough’s foolhardy crusade. Shortly after the chief executive’s decree, Spinrad met with a couple of Xerox officials sent belatedly from Stamford to El Segundo to appraise the division’s competitive ability in the new market.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How good is your COBOL compiler?” they asked. COBOL was the tedious programming language used for repetitive and uncomplicated business programs such as payrolls and budgets. On hearing the question, Bob Spinrad recognized as though for the first time the enormity of the task confronting the company. Scientific and research programmers, like those who worked for SDS and its traditional customers, would not be caught dead working in COBOL, which they considered a lame language suitable only for clerks and drones. He shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s not a question of how good our COBOL compiler is,” he told the visitors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Because we don’t have one.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xerox had thoroughly misunderstood the difference between scientific computing, in which SDS might with great effort manage to hold its own, and business computing, in which it was a non-starter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The company could not offer a fraction of the product line any business client would expect as a matter of course, whether high-speed line printers or robust database programs. As Spinrad recalled,</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A lot of things that were ho-hum standard operating procedure for companies that served a commercial environment just weren’t in our lexicon or armament.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The harvest was a profound morale crisis in El Segundo, where every employee understood what the company’s limitations were, how hard it would be to change course, and how determined Xerox was to do it anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One weekend McGurk summoned his department heads to a weekend “retreat” in a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport to iron out the difficulties. They broke into study groups, turned over the issues late into the night, and reconvened around a very long conference table on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“All right,” McGurk said. “One by one, let’s have your reaction to whether we can make this change.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I said, ‘No, I’ve got a problem,’” Spinrad recalled. “McGurk went around the table and, one by one, everyone else said the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">‘I’ve got this problem,’ ‘I’ve got that problem.’” McGurk fell silent for a moment, then slammed his fist on the table. “Okay,” he said, “we’ll do it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this cheerless atmosphere PARC’s request for a PDP-10 deton-ated like a grenade. It had been only a few months earlier that SDShad launched its latest scientific computer, the Sigma 7—designed  cally to compete head to head with the PDP-10. Having been ordered to stage a frontal assault on IBM’s market, SDS now felt tripped up by the rearguard action launched by its own corporate brethren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">SDS executives wasted no time in starting a campaign at headquarters to kill the proposal. “I was for anything that would keep them from buying that computer,” recalled Currie, who outlined for the Stamford brass a scenario in which a computing trade magazine like  <i class="calibre6">Datamation</i> splashed a photograph across its front cover of a DEC truck pulled up to the loading dock of Xerox PARC.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Try selling a Sigma machine to another customer after that!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor maintained that his group considered the PDP-10 so self-evidently superior to the Sigma they never gave a moment’s thought to how their request would resonate in El Segundo. Yet they could not have been entirely blind to the fact that the Stamford bosses regarded big computers as fungible commodities, one very much like another. After all, these were the people who had bought the wrong computer company to begin with, then compounded the gaffe by urging it to compete in a manifestly inappropriate market. No one should have been surprised that they would regard PARC’s insistence on buying a rival company’s machine as an act of sheer perversity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The task of formally vetoing the request fell to the company’s new chief information officer, a systems expert named Paul Strassmann.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Strassmann’s primary job was to install an SDS computer wherever Xerox currently ran an IBM machine. He came with sterling qualifications, since his greatest accomplishment as the computing czar at his previous company, Kraft Foods, was to junk its system of under-performing IBM 360 data processing computers and replace them with Honeywells.</p>
<p class="calibre2">IBM’s failed attempt to get him fired for this rare affront had left Strassmann with no shortage of self-confidence in his own judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A severe character whose Teutonic accent soon won him the nickname “the Prussian” at PARC, he imagined his greater role to be that of Xerox’s technological policeman. He harbored no illusions about the stupidity of forcing SDS to compete with IBM, a move he regarded as “just a spastic afterthought” by management. But he also believed his responsibility was to ride herd on the proliferation of incompatible computers at Xerox offices around the globe. He was not about to rubber-stamp a half-million-dollar purchase order for a DEC computer to please anyone, research hotshots included. He boomeranged the PDP-10 order back to PARC with instructions to produce a point-by-point technical justification, in writing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This turned out to be the start of fifteen years of miscommunication and hostility between Xerox’s east coast and west. “I told them to show me what the PDP—10 would do that the Sigma 7 wouldn’t,” Strassmann recalled. “This is what hardass corporate information officers do. They say, ‘Show me a competitive analysis.’ But PARCnever sent one. They thought it was beneath them to show a technical analysis to the headquarters guys. They didn’t know how to act like corporate citizens. They just said, ‘Don’t ask questions.’” The battle raged for weeks. The official SDS line was that the PDP’s popularity over the Sigma among researchers was purely an accident of timing and would soon correct itself. As Currie, a savvy enough computer man but one whose judgment was colored by his position at SDS, recalled, “The PDP had come out a little earlier than the Sigma and they were ahead of us mostly in software.” He thought the issue boiled down to “a question of religion,” and the least PARCcould do as a new Xerox facility was try a new theology on for size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Stamford the battle was viewed even more simple-mindedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Headquarters executives thought of software as the gobbledygook that made a machine run, like the hamster driving the wheel. They could not understand why the decision between the PDP—10 and the Sigma needed to be any more complicated than, say, choosing an albino rodent over a brown one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But from a technical point of view, the issue was hardly that casual. Software was the factor that defined the fundamental incompatibility between the Sigma and PDP machines and the superiority, for PARC’s purposes, of the latter. The architectures of the two computers were so radically different that software written for the PDP would not properly fit into the memory space the Sigma allocated for data. Even if the program could be made to run—a doubtful prospect—it would require nearly twice as much memory to run as fast on the Sigma as it did on the PDP—10. Given the high price of memory at the time, this was a major shortcoming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it was theoretically possible to simply “port” all the PDP software over to the Sigma, the CSL engineers calculated that such a job would mean rewriting every single line of every PDPprogram, a task that would take three years and cost $4 million.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The only lie in the analysis we did,” Lampson later remarked,</p>
<p class="calibre2">“was that we never could actually have done it because you couldn’t have motivated people to do such a pointless thing.” This was, indeed, the very technical analysis Strassmann had demanded. He received it, too, as part of the lab’s capital request—but because it focused on software costs it was not the sort of analysis he expected, which would have been a hardware-by-hardware comparison of the two machines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In a way we were cooking the books,” Lampson stated later, “but actually this was a pretty accurate way of turning the facts about doing computing research into dollar numbers that Strassmann could understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Taylor invited a group of El Segundo designers to Palo Alto for a two-day “discourse” on the technical issues. His goal was to persuade them that the Sigma and PDP—10 were not really competing in the same market, and they should therefore back off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead of engaging in the civil dialogue he had hoped for, however, his cocksure engineers pitilessly dissected the Sigma’s shortcomings in front of its designers and Pake, who was sitting in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor had to admit that the affair was a complete frost. “It ended up like a trial,” he said. “Butler and Chuck Thacker knew the Sigma system very well, and they just demolished the Sigma 7. They gave the SDS people fits.” When the inquisition finally concluded, Pake took Taylor aside. “You sure know a bunch of smart people,” he said. “Butler Lampson seems to understand those guys’ machines better than they do.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Neither side seemed able to budge, despite Pake’s efforts to find grounds for a truce. He recalled “I asked my guys, ‘Is there any way we can reconfigure that Sigma machine and make it work?’ The answer kept coming back no from everybody. Meanwhile we talked to SDSto see if they were interested in making any changes. They weren’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They wanted to sell us whatever they had.” Pake’s desperation communicated itself to the computer scientists.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The choices indeed looked bleak. They could accept the Sigma, which meant suffering with an inadequate machine  <i class="calibre6">and</i> knuckling under to the corporate suits the very first time their interests conflicted. Or they could stand their ground and browbeat Xerox into buying them the PDP. “But that would cost us so many brownie points we figured it was not a good idea,” Lampson recalled. Not a few times in the heat of discussion was the suggestion heard that they should all just quit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet a different impulse, one much more powerful, was beginning to assert itself. This was the engineer’s equivalent to the “fight or flight” syndrome, the instinct when confronted by an obstacle not to back off, but to barrel through it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We started having these long discussions,” Alan Kay remembered. “I was saying, ‘Let’s not chuck our badges in just yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s think it through.’” Someone else suggested that perhaps they were looking at the question from the wrong end. They had made an issue out of hardware—what machine to buy—when their real concern was software—what programs they could run. What if they simply built their own machine to run the programs they needed?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Asking the question was the same as answering it. “The talk,” Kay said, “turned to how long it would take us to  <i class="calibre6">build</i> our own PDP—10.” The answer was about one year and less than $1 million.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The truth was that Xerox had only forbidden the lab to buy a PDP—10. Nobody had said anything about cloning one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We were fearless,” Lampson recalled. “We had built this BCCmachine which was a substantially more complicated and elaborate machine than a PDP—10. And furthermore the underlying technology was evolving very rapidly, so we actually had much better physical resources at our disposal. We had great confidence that we could build this thing with a fairly modest investment of effort, and very little risk. Which turned out to be absolutely correct.” The machine, he said, “was not built because Xerox refused to let us buy a PDP—10, but because we thought it was the path of least resistance.” Work on the clone began in February. Thacker assumed the role of project manager as well as the bedrock task of designing the internal logic. The other jobs got apportioned out to the lab members willy-nilly, as among townspeople at a community barn-raising, often with little relation to the work in which they were most expert—but then, anyone who could make it through Taylor’s selection process was assumed to be smart enough to learn anything. Lampson was an operating systems designer  <i class="calibre6">nonpareil</i>, for example, but with Tenex they already had their operating system. So he was dragooned into designing the central processor, a hardware task unlike anything he had ever undertaken in his life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another who got swept into the project was Ed McCreight, an ex-Boeing engineer of unshakably sunny disposition who was still in his first week or two on the job, “rummaging around for something to do.” No one could remain in that state for long at PARC. Thacker lassoed him into designing the disk controller, a hardware unit that would supervise the way the machine moved data to and from a spinning magnetic hard disk. McCreight recalled, “I told him, ‘I don’t know squat about disk controllers but, hey, I’m game. If you promise to answer all of my questions I’ll do it.’” They all were game because they viewed the task as the construction of their own laboratory. One principle Taylor imparted to his people was that the things they built had to be designed for daily use. Too many research labs turned out playthings and prototypes designed to go on a shelf, as though merely for display.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They show wonderful things and nothing much ever comes of them,” he complained. That would not happen on his watch. They would build nothing that could not be put to work, because that was the only way to find out in the end if the stuff was any good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This rule would become one of the hallmarks of PARC’s creative method. Undoubtedly it held special meaning for the CSL members who had lived through the painful saga of Berkeley Computer, whose machine relied too much on idealistic designs and not enough on working pragmatism. As Kay recalled, “Within a couple of weeks after the BCC people showed up Butler got up at a meeting. BCChad failed and he was still venting. He said he was sick and tired of the sixties, when your stuff ‘sort of’ worked and you could usually get it to work long enough for a demo, but that was about it. He said we should decide never to make something at PARC that isn’t engineered for a hundred users. If we were building a time-sharing computer, it should support a hundred people, a network should take a hundred connections, and so on. Our initial reaction to that was, ‘Gee, it’s really going to cramp our style.’ But in fact the extra thought we had to put into everything in order to support it for a hundred users made things work so much better that it probably sped us up by a factor of three.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The idea that they were building their own computing environment galvanized them into working at breakneck speed, like settlers hastening to erect a rudimentary shelter before the onset of a hard winter. An almost alchemical change overtook the lab, infusing it with the pure excitement of discovery that a research manager may be lucky to witness once in a lifetime. People would contend later that being forced to clone the PDP—10 was the best thing that ever happened to CSL—even Strassmann eventually bragged, “I made everyone a hero.” This is the period they were referring to, when a bunch of disparate talents came together in appreciation of the virtues of working together on challenges that had virtually no precedent and the air filled with new ideas. Then there was the added satisfaction of testing their mastery of a new technology. “It was fun,” Lampson said later, “to see how easy it was.” The fundamental problem was that to the extent the PDP—10’s physical design belonged to Digital Equipment Corporation it could not simply be copied, at least not legally. In any case, no one at PARChad spent enough time inside that machine to reproduce it circuit for circuit. The trick was to turn this limitation into an advantage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the task at hand was not really to build a PDP—10, only a machine that would follow the same instructions as a PDP—10, there was no reason not to find a shortcut. The best shortcut, as they all knew, was to substitute their own microcode for the PDP—10’s wiring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">DEC’s machine, as it happened, was the epitome of the “ wired” computer. Its operation depended on the physical configuration of its transistors; these were arranged into intricately linked</p>
<p class="calibre2">“gates”—the building blocks of traditional digital computers that received electrical impulses at one end and passed, propagated, blocked, or modified them according to the rules of binary mathematics and nineteenth-century Boolean logic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From thousands of these devices, artfully arranged, could be constructed a machine able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide; read a character from a teletype and output it to a cathode-ray screen; or forecast the trajectory of a launched missile. But it was no longer necessary to fashion the gates out of wires and transistors. In place of much of the PDP—10’s intricate circuitry the CSL engineers planned to substitute a class of software known as microcode.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One can think of microcode as a way of allowing digital signals to replicate the twists and turns of a hard-wired machine’s circuits without actually traversing the physical pathways. Microcode examines a programmed instruction, determines where it would end up if it primly followed all the wiring, and deposits it in the right place without making the arduous overland trek.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Microcode’s great advantage over hard-wiring is that, as Lampson notes, “it’s much easier to express something complicated in program instructions, or micro-instructions, than directly in gates.” Detect a bug in a hard-wired machine and you have to rip out the errant circuits and solder in new ones. With microcode you just rewrite the program. It is as though in traversing the United States from Boston to San Francisco you find that the paved highway through Cincinnati leads not to San Francisco but San Diego. Microcode would be the equivalent of getting on an airplane and changing the flight path rather than ripping up and relocating the highway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Translating hardware into software in quest of this simplicity is, as processes go, fiendishly complex—the digital signals take a lot more twists and turns in microcode than in a hard-wired machine; but to Taylor’s group its mysteries were an open book. The BCC 500was microcoded, as was the FLEX machine Kay designed for his Utah doctorate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We knew a lot about microcode,” recalled the latter, who contributed some conceptual ideas while observing CSL’s actual design and construction of the machine from the sidelines. “One of the world’s great micro-coders, Ed Fiala, was with us, so that was a big plus.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the great hardware designers, Thacker, was there, that was a big plus. The minus was that there were only about ten people to do it all. And it had to be done quickly.” Once they settled on-the new course of action, a whole world of possibilities suddenly opened to them. They could not only clone the PDP—10; they could  <i class="calibre6">improve</i> on it. The first place to do so was the memory. PDP machines used ferrite core memory, the standard in the industry since its invention in 1951 by Jay Forrester at MIT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Core memories were made of tiny rings (or “cores”) woven into a mat of copper filaments that allowed each ring to be magnetically polarized. The cores held, or “remembered,” their charge until deliberately overridden, leaving a pattern to be read back and interpreted as data bits in storage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Core’s great virtue was its reliability. But it had to be manufactured by hand and suffered from the defects of great bulkiness and slow speed. The 300-kilobyte core memory of Wes Clark’s TX—2, for instance, was a handmade block of about a cubic yard, or the size of a large file cabinet, costing roughly half a million dollars. This volume of memory was large for its time but trivial by today’s standards, when a desktop computer’s semiconductor memory can hold about one hundred times as much information in the physical volume of a couple of credit cards, at a cost of about forty dollars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By 1971 core memories were about to be supplanted by a brand-new technology based on silicon semiconductors. The previous October a one-kilobit memory chip (that is, 1,024 bits of memory per chip) had been introduced by Intel, a young engineering company cofounded by Gordon Moore of “Moore’s law” fame.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Intel’s 1103 chip was struggling for acceptance in the computer industry, largely because its peculiarities gave system designers migraines. The 1103 memories were “volatile,” meaning that all the stored data were wiped out whenever the chip’s charge was lost.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the 1103’s charge had a tendency to gradually leak away, the chip had to be recharged, or refreshed, by zapping it with an electrical impulse several thousand times a  <i class="calibre6">second</i> to keep data from evaporating. (Cores, by contrast, were</p>
<p class="calibre2">“nonvolatile,” meaning they held their stored data indefinitely, charged or not.) The 1103 required users to supply it with all sorts of “weird voltages,” as Lampson later put it, and looked like it might be prone to a host of data errors arising from the density at which designers crammed it with microscopic transistors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Such flaws made the 1103 a spectacularly stubborn and perverse contrivance. Its patriarch, Gordon Moore, termed it “the most difficult-to-use semiconductor ever created by man.” It was also hard to manufacture. Intel had so much difficulty turning out an economical volume of working chips that it had to assign entire teams of engineers and technicians to the drudgery of picking good chips out from the river of useless silicon coming off the fabrication line, a job so fervently detested it was labeled “turd polishing.” To the CSL team, however, the 1103’s shortcomings were obstacles to be overcome. “It seemed pretty clear to us that the memory should be semiconductor, although we didn’t really know whether those chips worked—and it turned out later that they don’t,” Lampson recalled. “We certainly would have preferred a more robust chip.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But we were very confident that by putting in error correction we could make up a very satisfactory system that  <i class="calibre6">would</i> work.” That was an understatement. As CSL well knew, if they could only overcome the 1103’s manifold obstinacies, their machine would boast the speediest and most reliable memory on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">CSL’s resolution of the PDP-Sigma imbroglio failed to quell entirely SDS’s discontent with the outcome. From El Segundo was heard continuous carping that PARC had caused the division insup-portable embarrassment by spurning its top-of-the-line product.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This provoked Pake into an outburst that settled the matter once and for all. In a blistering memo he reminded headquarters that his best new engineers had voluntarily agreed to suspend bona fide research projects for the year or more it would take them to satisfy SDS’s querulous concerns. “It is unthinkable to me that Xerox sets me the task of hiring creative, imaginative, top-rank researchers and then expects me to insist that they handcuff themselves with inappropriate equipment,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I will do my best to provide them with the kind of first-rate technical support it is reasonable to expect in Xerox research laboratories. If that is the wrong way to build a first-rate corporate research center for Xerox, then I am the wrong man for the job.” Meanwhile, the CSL rank and file’s lingering resentment at their Southern California in-laws was manifested when the time came to give their clone a name. One afternoon a group of engineers gathered at someone’s house to mark an intermediate milestone on the project.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A moderate amount of beer had been consumed and we were trying to figure out what to name this thing and there was considerable hilarity,” Thacker recalled of the day they came up with the formal moniker of “Multiple Access Xerox Computer.” It sounded conventional, but everyone on the scene got the joke. In honor of the man who had sold his lousy computer company to Xerox, the first major project undertaken by PARC would be known for all time by the acronym “MAXC.” No member of the lab ever forgot to remind outsiders, “The ‘C’ is silent.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">MAXC’s christening was more than an opportunity to tweak Max Palevsky. It crystallized their awareness that what was coming together in the Computer Science Lab was no longer a DEC machine, but their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We did everything, from soup to nuts,” McCreight said. Liberated from slavish adherence to the PDP—10 design, they were able to get dozens of functions running faster or cheaper. McCreight performed one such feat with his disk controller. Conventional disk controllers were generally equipped with their own separate processing units, like Stegosauruses with their second brains, which added significantly to their cost and complexity. Poring over the system schematics in his office one day, he was struck by the realization that there would occur certain periods when, having executed one instruction and not yet received the next, MAXC’s central processor would be idle but available, like a car left running unattended in the driveway.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre6">The point was probably lost on the target. As Pake said later, “I doubt that Max Palevsky ever cared, or even knew about it.”</i> </p>
<p class="calibre2">“I learned enough about the processor to realize I could use some of those spare cycles,” he recounted. “In effect I could kidnap the processor to do some arithmetic for the disk controller. I wouldn’t have to put so many gates into the disk controller”—saving another few thousand dollars in hardware—” if I could periodically borrow the processor to compute some of the things I needed to compute.” McCreight’s realization was their first embrace of the concept of</p>
<p class="calibre2">“multitasking”—giving the processor numerous jobs to juggle at once. Implemented on this modest scale in MAXC, it was destined to pay enormous dividends later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, they continued to inject refinements into the PDP—10design. If along the way they discovered some flaw, an inelegance or vulgarity committed by the original designers, they had no com-punction about fixing it. At least once this resulted in making MAXC</p>
<p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre6">too</i> good. This was the episode of Fiala’s floating-point bug.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Floating point operations allow computers to handle huge numbers by breaking them into two pieces: the mantissa, which comprises the significant digits, and the exponent, which is a power of ten.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus the number 632,100,000 would be split into a mantissa of 6.321and an exponent of eight (i.e., 10 to the 8th power). To multiply two numbers in a floating-point operation, the computer simply multiplies the mantissas and sums the exponents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Floating point functions are critical to the efficient use of a computer’s resources. But they are among the most difficult to properly implement in hardware. Sure enough, while coding the floating point microcode Fiala discovered a number of bugs in the PDPhardware, or at least places where he could improve on it. Without thinking twice, he did so. As McCreight recalled, “He figured it’s his floating point, and it was up to him to make it more accurate than the PDP’s.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the classic frustrations of systems design is that fixing a bug in one place often creates others elsewhere, the way squeezing a balloon at one end makes it bulge out at the other. Something like that happened in this case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the MAXC team tried to launch a program called Interlisp that had been written for the original PDP—10, “for some reason we couldn’t bring it up,” McCreight said. “We couldn’t even find <i class="calibre6">nil</i>, which is the first thing you look for in Lisp—if you can’t find  <i class="calibre6">nil</i>, you’re in trouble.” The problem, as they discovered after hours of tedious investigation, was that Interlisp utilized the PDP’s inefficient floating-point algorithms to execute its own code. Fiala’s fixes left the program hopelessly confused, as though someone had rearranged its furniture in the dark. Unfortunately, one reason they were building MAXCwas to run Lisp. So with a great show of reluctance, Fiala acceded to pressure from the rest of the lab—and programmed the bugs back in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As they anticipated, Intel’s 1103 memory chips proved to be a major nuisance. The reputedly serviceable chips that survived the</p>
<p class="calibre2">“turd polishing” stage still arrived at PARC with their deeply flawed design intact. Among the headaches was their so-called pattern sensitivity: Certain combinations of bits would cause an intermediate bit to “flip,” so that a sequence of 1001 might read out incorrectly as 1101 or 1011.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker overcame the fault with an error correction system that could identify and reflip erroneous bits. This worked as long as they only occurred one at a time. Eventually, however, a second bit would fail. “Then,” Thacker recalled, “you’d get an honest error and the system would crash and we’d have to change the chip.” That was not as rare an occurrence as it might seem. For a time MAXC boasted the largest semiconductor memory of any computer in the world, an achievement that temporarily made PARC Intel’s single biggest customer. Approximately 25,000 of the 1103s got packed into four cabinets standing six feet high, each one containing four card cages with sixteen circuit boards that in turn were each about the height and width of a standard sheet of typewriter paper and held ninety-six chips apiece.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The memory boards were the only part of MAXC the lab sent outside for fabrication. “There were so many of them—two hundred and fifty-six, not including spares—that it was economical to make a printed circuit board for the memory, which was not an inconsiderable task in those days,” Thacker recalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At one point the need for a dependable board-maker threatened to set Thacker on a life of crime. Intel had sublicensed the manufacture of 1103s to a Canadian company called Microsystems International Ltd., or MIL, a subsidiary of the Canadian telephone company.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They offered to make boards at a substantially lower price than we were paying,” Thacker said. “I remember going to Ottawa one time carrying a sample memory board with me, at that time a one-thousand-dollar object.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As he breezed through Canadian Customs, he was stopped by an officer who asked what he was carrying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a printed circuit board,” Thacker replied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’ll have to pay duty on that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But it’s just a prototype. I’m bringing it in today and bringing it back out tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In that case you’ll have to pay duty both ways. What’s it worth?” Thacker thought quickly. “About fifteen dollars.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh,” the officer said, waving him through. “If that’s all, don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Notwithstanding the stubborn 1103s, MAXC proved a superbly robust machine thanks to Thacker’s inspired design and the lab’s resourceful craftsmanship. Because Thacker had designed in more physical memory than was needed for all its logical operations, whole memory boards could be pulled out for repair without taking the system down for even a nanosecond. Once fully debugged, the machine set records for uninterrupted availability on the ARPANET, handily outperforming computers that had taken squadrons of engineers years to design. In contrast, the Computer Science Lab at PARC implemented MAXC in scarcely more than eighteen months.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cost to Xerox was about $750,000, of which roughly a third went for the memory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All this was accomplished under intense deadline pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Everybody was waiting for MAXC to exist,” recalled McCreight, whose office at Porter Drive was so crammed with equipment—six-foot-high racks holding twenty-four spinning disks on two spindles, arranged one on top and one below like pizza ovens—there was barely room for human beings. “Every day guys would show up in my office and say, ‘How soon, is it coming now?’ So we knew it was a very much desired thing. I mean, the point of the lab was to program and we couldn’t program until we had the computer system.” As Taylor anticipated, moreover, the seemingly make-work project paid exponential dividends in group dynamics. At first glance, devoting so much time and money to reproducing a computer available on the open market seemed sheer profligacy. But from Taylor’s point of view, the assignment to produce a real machine had given his engineers a unique opportunity to parse out their own strengths and weaknesses in ways Taylor could never have devised himself. What emerged at the end of the program was a seamless, remarkably powerful unit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In a small group the dynamics are like those on a good basketball team,” Kay observed. “Everybody has to be able to play the whole game. Each person should have certain things they’re better at than the others, but everyone should be pretty good at everything.” MAXC proved they were all pretty good at everything that mattered: hardware, software, microcoding, programming. “They made having to do MAXC into a virtue. No matter how you slice it, the job was amazing. It was not trivial. Not even close to trivial.” It was, however, merely the first step in a long journey. MAXCwas barely finished before they started thinking about what to do next. </p>
