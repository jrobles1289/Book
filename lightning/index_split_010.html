<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">T</b>he photograph shows a handsome man in a checked sport shirt, his boyish face half-obscured by a cloud of pipe smoke. Robert W. Taylor looks amused and slightly out of date, his sandy hair longer than one might wear it today but unfashionably short for the distant time period when the picture was taken by the famous photographer of a trendy magazine. His gaze is fixed on something beyond the camera as though contemplating the future, which would befit the man who brought together perhaps the greatest collection of computer engineering talent ever to work in one place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On a sunny afternoon in July 1996 the same photograph looked down at a gathering of that same talent in the open-air restaurant of a Northern California winery. There were some changes from when it was first shot, however. This time the picture was blown up bigger than life, and the people celebrating under its amused gaze had aged a quarter-century.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were there to mark the retirement of Bob Taylor, the unlikely impresario of computer science at Xerox PARC. Among the guests were several of his intellectual mentors, including a few who ranked as
genuine Grand Old Men of a young and still-fluid discipline. This group included Wes Clark, an irascible genius of hardware design who started his career when even the smallest computers had to be operated from within their cavernous entrails; and seated not far away, the flinty Douglas C. Engelbart, the uncompromising prophet of multimedia interactivity whose principles of graphical user interfaces and mouse-click navigation were disdained in his own time but have become ubiquitous in ours.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of the company, however, consisted of Bob Taylor’s chosen people. They were unabashed admirers whose careers he had launched by inviting them to sit beneath his commodious wing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Geniuses, prodigies, owners of doctorates from the leading halls of learning, they lived in the thrall of this psychologist from The University of Texas who stammered frightfully when trying to communicate an abstruse technical point, yet still managed to impart a vision of computing that reigns today on millions of desktops. Many moved on to more splendid achievements and some to astounding wealth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But none ever forgot how profoundly their professional lives were changed when Bob Taylor fixed them with his discerning eye and invited them to enlist in his tiny company of believers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As a leader of engineers and scientists he had no equal,” said Chuck Thacker, who worked beside him longer than almost anyone else. “If you’re looking for the magic, it was him.” Thacker served as the afternoon’s master of ceremonies. Under his deft supervision the familiar old Bob Taylor stories got dusted off to be howled over anew. Bob arranging for Dr Pepper, the Texas state drink, to be imported into PARC “by the pallet load and stored in a special locked vault.” Bob bombing through the streets of Washington in his Corvette Stingray as though saddled on a wild stallion. Or rigging his Alto to beep out “The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You” whenever he received an e-mail message on PARC’s unique internal network. Taylor listened to it all in great good humor from the table of honor, way in the back, dressed in a short-sleeved striped shirt and resplendent cherry-red slacks. But then, nothing ever pleased him more than functioning as the lodestar of the proceedings while pretending to be nothing but an unassuming bystander.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Charles Simonyi, who was a naïve young Hungarian immigrant without a green card when Taylor brought him to PARC in 1972, flew down from Seattle in his own Learjet, one of the perquisites that accrue to a man who moved from PARC to become employee number forty of a small company named Microsoft.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I remember Bob preparing me to deal with the three most powerful forces of the twentieth century,” he said. “One of these was personal distributed computing. The second was the Internet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the third very powerful force is football.” Appreciative laughter rippled across the floor. Everyone present understood football as an emblem of the darker currents driving Bob Taylor’s personality and career. They knew that as a competitor he was an absolutely ruthless creature and that to protect and glorify the work of his group he would blindly trample anyone in the way like a fullback scenting the goal line—be they rivals, superiors, or members of his own circle judged to have fallen prey to heretical thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Over the years these habits left a trail of roasted relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of the guests at the retirement lunch were polite enough not to remark openly that the company giving Taylor the gold watch was Digital Equipment Corporation, not Xerox. Or that among the party’s conspicuous absentees were George Pake, who had hired him to establish and oversee the computer science laboratory at PARC, and Pake’s successor, Bill Spencer, who evicted Taylor from PARC more than a decade later. The common knowledge was that for every guest who owed a career to the guest of honor there existed not a few individuals who had felt the sting of Taylor’s rivalry and damned him as one of the most arrogant, elitist, and unprincipled persons on the planet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The allusions to this discomfiting truth were mostly indirect. At his touch football games, it was recalled, he was always the quarterback. The former PARC engineer Dick Shoup recalled how at softball Taylor would invariably wave all the other infielders off a pop-up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day Shoup complained, “Bob, the other people came to play, too!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But they might miss it!” Taylor snapped. “Don’t you want to win?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Others dropped hints about Bob’s genius at “managing down and in,” meaning pampering and defending his own team, without explicitly stating the corollary: At managing up and out he was often a disaster. Finally one old colleague put into words what everyone always knew. “It’s a lot better to work for Bob,” he observed, “than to have Bob working for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of the pioneers of personal computing in attendance that day had worked for Bob, not the reverse. At PARC for thirteen years he managed a world-class collection of technical virtuosi with the same uncompromising passion as Diaghilev, that impresario of an earlier age, guiding his own troupe of temperamental artists—soothing ruffled feathers here, mediating egotistical outbursts there, sheltering them from enemies, and clearing a psychic space so their talents could reinforce each other to build a whole immeasurably greater than the dazzling parts. No doubt there were times when the task demanded all the reserves of psychological discernment Taylor owned. That is to be expected when one is surrounded by thirty prodigies who are all measurably smarter than oneself (and know it). Yet seldom would any of them think of challenging his ultimate authority. In Bob Taylor’s lab you accepted his management, or you cleared out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How and where Taylor acquired his gift for finding and cultivating the most talented researchers in his field no one ever quite figured out. Part of it was instinct. He might not be able to articulate or even understand all the technical details, but somehow he always knew when a researcher or a project would lead to something important, and how to prepare the ground for that person or project to ripen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This mysterious quality of leadership was most aptly summed up by Butler Lampson, the only person on the floor who could match Thacker’s record of playing time with Bob Taylor. Lampson’s intellectual power was such a dominating feature of the Taylor lab that people joked about how it sometimes seemed that Bob Taylor worked for Butler Lampson rather than the other way around. Lampson disabused them of the notion by repeating the great old story about what occurred when he and Thacker were building the first PARC
computer. This was a time-sharing machine
called MAXC, which was cloned in the astoundingly short span of eighteen months from a leading minicomputer that had taken a major company years to develop (by coincidence, it was Digital Equipment). Taylor kept telling them they ought to be considering an alternative architecture without actually explaining just what alternative he had in mind. It was not until a couple of years later, when they completed work on the Alto, that they realized they had built what he meant them to from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The master often speaks in somewhat inscrutable fashion,” Lampson said to peals of knowing laughter, “with a deeper and more profound interpretation than his humble disciples are able to provide. In retrospect you can really see that the path has been plotted years in advance, and you’ve been following his footsteps all along.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not long after that retirement party Taylor invited me to visit him at his home in Woodside, a bedroom community for high-tech executives and entrepreneurs that overlooks Silicon Valley from atop a thickly forested ridge. “Leave plenty of time,” he said. “It’ll take you a good hour to get here from where you are.” One reaches his home via a steep climb up a hillside to the west of Palo Alto, past the ridgetop thoroughfare known as Skyline Drive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was terrifying to imagine him careening around those hairpins in his new BMW, the one with the license plate reading THE UDM (for</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The Ultimate Driving Machine”). At the front door of a house densely hemmed in by oaks and Douglas firs, Taylor greeted me in slippers. Around us bounded his hyperactive giant poodle, Max.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Down, boy! Go lay down!” Taylor commanded. The dog humored his master for about five seconds before getting up to rampage again, about as tractable as Taylor must have been when confronted with a distasteful injunction from his own bosses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From his comfortable living room one can peer down through the windows on either side of a pale stone fireplace toward the Hoover Tower of Stanford University, six miles away as the crow flies and eleven by road. PARC is invisible from this vantage point, except perhaps in Taylor’s imagination. Divorced, his three sons grown and employed, he lives alone in this aerie and spends a certain amount of time fighting the last
war. For him the world is easily divided between the geniuses he employed and those from whom he struggled to protect them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked him to articulate the common theme lurking behind the great innovations achieved under his leadership. These included the ARPANET, the embryonic Internet he conceived and financed as a Pentagon  <i class="calibre6">grantmeister</i> before joining PARC, and the idea of the personal computer, linked into a local network and equipped with a high-quality interactive display.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He settled back, slippers on the coffee table. “I was never interested in the computer as a mathematical device, but as a communications device,” he said, then paused meaningfully, as if to suggest that I would almost have had to live within the military-industrial complex of the 1960s to understand how revolutionary a worldview that was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The history of the digital computer up to then was that of a glorified calculator. A mainframe taking up half the floor of a large office building could run a payroll, balance the books of a billion-dollar corporation, calculate in split seconds the optimum trajectory of an artillery shell or a manned spacecraft aimed at the moon. But it was a mute self-contained machine that received its questions via teletype or stacks of punch cards and delivered its answers in the same way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The notion of a human being having to punch holes in lots of cards, keep these cards straight, and then take this deck of what might be hundreds and hundreds of cards to a computer…You come back the next day and find out that your program executed up until card 433 and then stopped because you left out a comma. You fix that and this time the program gets to card 4006 and stops because you forgot to punch an O instead of a zero or some other stupid reason. It was bleak.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor perceived the need for something entirely new. “I started talking functionally,” he said. He asked himself: Which organ provides the greatest bandwidth in terms of its access to the human brain? Obviously, the eyeball. If one then contemplated how the computer could best communicate with its human operator, the answer suggested itself. “I thought the machine should concentrate its resources on the display.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The computer traditionalists goggled at him. Most were mathematicians or physicists and thus perfectly content to employ calculators the
size of cement trucks in quest of the next prime number. In 1968, when he and his mentor, the eminent psychologist J.C.R. Licklider, published an article entitled “The Computer as a Communications Device,” the kind of interactive display he was talking about would have consumed memory and processing power worth a million dollars even if limited to the size of a small television screen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It took me a couple of years to get them to come around. The designers said, the display? That’s crazy, the display is peripheral!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I said, No, the display is the entire point!” The rest of his career would be devoted to making sure they never forgot it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bob Taylor was born in 1932. If one quarries his early life for keys to his temperament, two things stand out. One is his family’s itinerant lifestyle. His father, the Reverend Raymond Taylor, was a Methodist minister in the West Texas of the Depression at a time when church policy was to relocate its ministers every couple of years. There would be two or three years in Uvalde a couple of hours north of the Mexican border, followed by a few in Victoria, Ozona, or Mercedes, none of these places notable for much except the wrenching poverty of field and ranch hands. Even today this is a region where one out of three residents lives below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This went on until almost the onset of war, when his father took a job teaching philosophy and religion at the Methodist University of San Antonio. The frequent relocations had already left their mark on the boy. “You’ve got to make a new set of friends and interact with a new set of prejudices every time,” he recalled. Living under the spotlight that falls on the local minister’s son scarcely made things any easier. “There’s the usual number of fights you have to go through to find out where you stand in the pecking order.” By the time he was ten Bob Taylor had mastered the skill of establishing his place in the local hierarchy and holding it against all comers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The second element was something his mother, Audrey, revealed to him at a very early age. He had been adopted as a twenty-eight-day-old infant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The first bedtime story I remember being told was about how I had been chosen. Picked out by my mother and father. All the other parents had to take what they got, but I was chosen. That probably gave me an undeserved sense of confidence.” He chuckled in a rare moment of self-deprecation. But throughout his adult life few things would be as sacred to Bob Taylor as the process of selection. For him it was almost an anointing. He would be the one doing the choosing, but he expected the select to feel invested with the same confidence he had felt, and the same profound gratitude.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the war he was ready for college—or rather, not ready at all. There was a short stint at Southern Methodist University (“I majored in campusology”) followed by a break for the Korean War, which he spent as a naval reserve officer landlocked at the Dallas Naval Air Station. The G.I. Bill paid for a berth at The University of Texas, where he followed an eccentric course of study for another two years. “One day in 1956 I realized I’d been in school an awfully long time. I walked into the Dean’s office to find out what it would take to graduate. They checked and said, ‘If you take these two courses you can graduate next semester. Your major will be psychology and you’ll have minors in mathematics, English, philosophy, and religion.’” In truth it was not quite as haphazard as that. He stayed long enough to earn a master’s in sensory psychology, the study of how the brain receives input from the senses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The year 1961 found Bob Taylor in Washington, D.C., which he had reached by a circuitous route. After leaving UT he had briefly taught at an experimental boarding school run by a friend outside Orlando, Florida. But the arrival of his second and third children, twin boys, quickly put an end to life as a dormitory housemaster on $3,600 a year. He found a job at Martin Aircraft, which was building the mobile missile system known as Pershing at a nearby plant. A year later he jumped to a better-paying post with a Maryland company designing flight simulators for the military. What caught his attention here was the tremendous power of information delivered interactively. This was a principle everyone understood in the abstract, but got driven home only when they witnessed it in action: You could teach pilots from books and theory until your voice gave out, but find a way to place their hands on a joystick and their eyes on a simulated landscape and it was as though they were learning everything for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This job also led directly to his next stop. President Kennedy’s exhortation to place a man on the moon by the end of the decade had the fledgling National Aeronautics and Space Administration scrounging for management talent wherever it might surface. Taylor, by lucky coincidence, had tried to sell NASA on a research program using one of his simulators to explore a wide variety of sensory inputs. NASA was intrigued by the idea, but even more by its proponent. The agency agreed to fund further work by his company, but only if he joined NASA as the project manager.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not yet out of his twenties, the rural preacher’s son was in the thick of the most important government crash program since the Manhattan Project. He met with the original seven Mercury astronauts, the era’s reigning national heroes, and witnessed space shots first-hand. But such thrills soon paled. NASA and the Mercury program might appear the apogee of scientific glamour to a public devouring the polished hagiographies of the seven astronauts in  <i class="calibre6">Life</i> Magazine, but the truth was less splendid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We said we were going to the moon, but we were a hell of a long way from getting there,” Taylor recalled. “It was mostly engineering, and sometimes fairly pedestrian engineering. It wasn’t science, and I was  <i class="calibre6">much</i> more interested in science.” Deep down he was looking for a way out. He glimpsed it one day in 1962 when he received an unexpected invitation to an interagency meeting on computer technology. The summons came from the Pentagon, or more specifically from J.C.R. Licklider, an MIT behavioral psychologist who had taken charge of a new program at ARPA, the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor knew Licklider only by his forbidding reputation, which had been forged in the same specialty, psychoacoustics—the study of the psychology of hearing—in which Taylor had done his master’s thesis. What he did not anticipate was
that Licklider would compliment him on his thesis during their first meeting. “I was thirty in 1962, and he was internationally known,” Taylor said. “It floored me that he knew who I was.” In those days ARPA did science, not engineering. Founded in the nationwide panic that followed the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957, the agency at first focused almost exclusively on missile physics—specifically, how to bring the United States quickly up to par with the Soviets in shooting projectiles into Earth orbit. By 1962, however, when Licklider was tapped to run a new Information Processing Techniques Office, or IPTO, the urgency had waned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whatever military orientation ARPA still harbored was visible only as a sort of artifact, as when Licklider discovered by accident that one “cloak-and-dagger” project under his nominal jurisdiction was so highly classified even he was not cleared to know what it was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(“That made me nervous,” he admitted later.) ARPA had refocused itself on civilian research in broad scientific areas, some of them having only tenuous relevance to national security. “I did not feel much pressure to make a military case for anything,” Licklider told an interviewer years later. Of course, the Pentagon did expect that the agency’s work might serendipitously lead to. solutions of some of its technical problems, such as the vexing issue of “command and control”: how to employ effectively the immense volume of information generated on a battlefield to manage the armed forces’ increasingly elaborate weapons systems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For years the military had viewed this issue in terms of training the human beings with their fingers on the triggers. Licklider informed his bosses that the real solution lay in making the machine meet the human halfway. This was something he called “man-computer symbiosis,” a subject on which he happened to have published a paper two years earlier. Traditionally, problems had to be written and presented to the computer very carefully so the machine would understand every step. One tiny error, and all computation would cease. Try planning a battle under these conditions—you would be obliterated before reaching the second step in the process. But what if the system were designed so the computer was no longer a mute data manipulator, but a participant in a dialogue something, he had written in that paper, like “a colleague whose competence supplements your own?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nothing like that was possible given the technology of the time, but it could be foreseen. “Every time I had the chance to talk, I said the mission is interactive computing,” Licklider said, “I thought, this is going to revolutionize how people think, how things are done.” He promptly allocated most of the money in his budget to its pursuit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Licklider was a tall Midwesterner whose owlish glasses camou-flaged a warm and pleasant personality. He loved nothing more than bringing people together and insisted that even new acquaintances address him as “Lick.” A few months after joining ARPA he convened his summit of government agencies with computer research projects in their budgets. The group was an august one, encompassing not only ARPA and NASA but the research arms of the Navy, Army, and Air Force; the National Institutes of Health; and the National Science Foundation. When Lick opened the session by describing his own “very modest” program he left no doubt about who stood at the top of the computer funding pyramid. His $14
million budget, which already supported projects at MIT, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon University, was larger than those of all the other agencies  <i class="calibre6">combined</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Licklider’s program launched the golden age of government-funded computing research. Very soon he had established a full stable of academic scholars entitled to come back to his well whenever an appropriate new line of study struck their fancy. And Licklider defined “appropriate” broadly. He understood that computer research differed from traditional sciences like physics and chemistry, which lumbered incrementally from discovery to discovery, building on centuries of theory and experiment in a process that resembled geological accretion. Computing, by contrast, was young and explosive, driven forward as though by a series of pistol shots, every technological innovation inspiring a headlong leap ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His Information Processing Techniques Office accordingly awarded its contracts without any of the bureaucratic paperwork other agencies required. Recalled Wes Clark, who had introduced Licklider to his first digital computer—the Clark-designed TX-2—when they shared an office floor at MIT: “I almost felt as though I was called up from
time to time to see if I wouldn’t be willing to take another quarter of a million dollars off their hands.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time he left IPTO in 1964 to return to MIT, Licklider had set in motion numerous trailblazing projects aimed at making the computer more accessible to the user. Studies in graphics pointed toward new ways of displaying computer-generated information.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were initiatives in computer networking and new programming languages. Systems to reorganize the computer’s memory and processing cycles so it might serve many users simultaneously—which was known as time-sharing—brought the per-session cost of building and running these enormous contraptions down to a level that even midsized and small universities could afford.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lick’s successor seemed the perfect man to manage this expanding program. Ivan Sutherland was a brilliant MIT graduate who happened to be serving with the Army as a first lieutenant. Only twenty-six, he had already amassed an enviable research record, the crowning achievement of which had been the development of the first interactive computer graphics program. Known as Sketchpad, the system allowed a user to draw highly detailed and complex drawings directly on a computer’s cathode-ray screen using a light pen and store them in memory. Among the bonds uniting Lick and Sutherland was that the latter had designed Sketchpad during a protracted series of half-hour sessions on that very same TX-2 computer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Licklider left Sutherland with a $15 million budget, a workload that had grown far beyond what a single man could handle, and a suggested deputy: Bob Taylor. At first glance he was a strange choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor had never taken an advanced course in computing. He would never be able to design hardware or write a software program. But he displayed two qualities Licklider found appealing: an instinctive grasp of the promise of man-computer interaction, and an exceptionally high degree of “people skills.” Next to this, Lick and Sutherland figured, his inability to get down among the bits and electrons was scarcely significant. They could not have known that within a few short years Bob Taylor would outshine them both in his influence over computer research in the United States. The humble job of serving as deputy to a first lieutenant with a Pentagon
staff appointment was about to set Bob Taylor on the path to his, and the computer’s, destiny.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ivan Sutherland spent scarcely eighteen months at IPTO. Late in 1965 Harvard offered him a tenured position. He was officially gone by June 1966 but unofficially much earlier. By January or February that year Taylor was already running IPTO all by himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The apprenticeship had been short, but edifying enough. Taylor rapidly digested such important conventions of Pentagon life as the enormous significance of tiny gradations in rank. One day he learned that his own new assistant, a twenty-three-year-old MIT engineer named Barry Wessler, was to be assigned the humble civilian rank of GS-9. Too low: Taylor concluded the appropriate level would be GS-13. The difference was a trivial one in terms of pay, which was nearly the same for both grades. But Taylor reasoned that the higher rank would guarantee that Wessler got treated by the Pentagon’s brass hats as a seasoned professional rather than a greenhorn. This was a distinction certain to return dividends day after day in terms of Wessler’s interaction with military officialdom. (Plus there would be the satisfaction of having squeezed Pentagon rules until they squealed.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Wessler recalled, “Bob worked by finding out what he couldn’t do, and then going for it. He could have gotten me a level or two higher without too much trouble, but GS-13? That was off the scale.
But he got it done.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In contrast to the rigid protocol of the brass, ARPA’s civilian chiefs left Taylor undisturbed to fashion his program as he chose. What he chose was distinctly an extension of Licklider’s. Interactivity, time-sharing, graphics: All of Lick’s pet preoccupations became Taylor’s. He also shrewdly adjusted Licklider’s management style to fit his own extroverted personality. He would visit his grant recipients several times a year, but not solely to hear the researchers’
obligatory progress reports. He was engaged in something more like community outreach, developing new teams, nurturing up-and-coming young researchers, cultivating an entire new generation of virtuosi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor had spent enough time in academia to know that the most interesting intellectual ferment took place well below the stratum of full professor. “Who are your youngest faculty?” he would ask around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What are their ambitions? Where are the most impressive graduate students?” He tracked down the young prodigies, captivating them with the peculiar charm of a leader who seemed inclined more to listen and encourage than to dictate. An impresario needs a company to put on stage; Taylor, in one sense, was holding auditions. In another, he was reproducing one of the most meaningful moments of his own past. The persons he surrounded himself with would get there not by chance or breeding. They would be chosen, selected…adopted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In his first year as director Taylor organized one of what would become an annual series of nationwide IPTO research conferences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the surface this filled a troublesome communications vacuum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here were the top talents in the field of information processing, all working for ARPA on essentially the same problems. Yet most did not know each other except by reputation. He made the conference an annual affair, held each year at some different and gratifyingly
“interesting” place. One year winter might find the group skiing at Park City, Utah; the following year would bring them to New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not that the purpose was chiefly to play. Rather, it was to build a network of people mirroring the one he would soon propose for computers. Lifelong professional and personal bonds were forged at these events. They would start the day with a communal breakfast, followed by several hours of discussion in the morning. They would eat lunch together, then were set free until dinner, another communal affair. The day ended with further colloquia.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The daily discussions unfolded in a pattern that remained peculiar to Taylor’s management style for the rest of his career. Each participant got an hour or so to describe his work. Then he would be thrown to the mercy of the assembled court like a flank steak to a pack of ravenous wolves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I got them to argue with each other,” Taylor recalled with unashamed glee. They went at the intellectual roughhouse with the scientist’s unemotional candor, oblivious to everything but the substantiation of truth. “These were people who really cared about their work. They
weren’t interested in politics, they weren’t interested in impressing anybody,” Taylor said. “If they thought that something I was saying was dead wrong, they’d just as soon tell me as not. They’d just as soon tell one another as not if they thought  <i class="calibre6">they</i> were wrong. And in the end these people, all of whom were pretty bright, got to know one another better.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course he had another motive in fomenting the intellectual free-for-all. It was the best way he knew of gleaning what they were up to. He could have asked any of his principal investigators to sit him down and explain their work, it was true, but he figured the chances were slim that he would even know the right questions to ask. Better to let his experts challenge each other while he watched, like a platoon leader subjecting his men to the rigors of field maneuvers to see whether they will break, and if so, where. “This way I would get insights about their strengths or weaknesses that otherwise might be hidden from me,” he said. “If there were technical weak spots, they would almost always surface under these conditions. It was very, very healthy.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was not to be personal. Impugning a man’s thinking was acceptable, but never his character. Taylor strived to create a democracy where everyone’s ideas were impartially subject to the group’s learned demolition, regardless of the proponent’s credentials or rank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The same principle governed the once-a-year ARPA conferences Taylor established for graduate students. Faculty members and even Taylor himself were barred from these meetings. Barry Wessler, not long out of grad school himself, was delegated to supervise, receiving no instructions other than “to get people together and make something happen.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the first session the group piled on an unfortunate wild man from that backwater, the University of Utah, named Alan Kay. Kay had stepped forth in a public session to pitch his vision of a computer you could hold in your hand. He had already coined a name for it:</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Dynabook,” a notebook-shaped machine with a display screen and a keyboard you could use to create, edit, and store a very personal sort of literature, music, and art.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“He was crazy,” Wessler recalled. “People greeted the whole idea with disbelief and gave him a very tough time. He painted this picture of walking around with a computer under your arm, which we all thought was completely ridiculous.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor, meanwhile, was fully occupied in finding ways to push forward the frontiers of interactive computing. At the time, this meant advancing the technology of time-sharing because there was simply no other way to pay for the enormous computing resources an interactive system demanded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During his tenure Licklider had steered most ARPA funding to time-sharing projects of a certain majestic scale, such as MIT’s vast Multics program, whose aim was to design a system capable of supporting 300 users at once. Taylor encouraged his contractors to embrace smaller-scale projects as well. One of these, an effort at the University of California at Berkeley called Project Genie, was based on the principle that not every university could afford the multimillion-dollar General Electric 645 mainframe Multics required. Instead Genie aimed to design a system for no more than ten or twenty users.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If such a small machine could be widely distributed, Taylor reasoned, time-sharing might actually reach many more users than Multics could ever deliver.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Genie’s host machine was the SDS 930, which was made by an entrepreneurial three-year-old company in Southern California named Scientific Data Systems and sold for only about $73,000. The 930 was a popular entry in the commercial market, where it was widely admired for its exceptional speed, excellent reliability, and large storage capacity. The Genie team demonstrated that with a nominal amount of new hardware and clever reprogramming the versatile 930 could be turned into a small-scale time-sharing machine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then they proposed that Taylor arrange for Scientific Data Systems to bring out the modified 930 as a commercial product.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor gave the idea his enthusiastic endorsement. He invited Max Palevsky, the founder and chairman of SDS, to the Pentagon for what ripened into a memorable encounter. Palevsky, offered a government-funded research prototype on a silver platter, turned him down flat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The forty-two-year-old Palevsky was an executive whose heartfelt confidence in his own business acumen had been reinforced by his company’s extraordinary success. (In 1965, the year of his encounter with Taylor, SDS had earned more than $5 million in pre-tax profits.) But Palevsky had no use for time-sharing. SDS made its money selling small-and medium-sized computer systems for a niche market of universities and aerospace firms. To Palevsky the technology of time-sharing appeared too elaborate by half and the commercial market a black hole—even IBM, the bellwether performer in the computer industry, had run aground trying to implement a time-sharing strategy of its own. “It was a very sophisticated scheme,” Palevsky recalled, “and I just didn’t think there were that many sophisticated customers around.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Equally strong-willed, Taylor and Palevsky conceived an instant mutual antipathy that had them at cross-purposes from the start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor tried to draw Palevsky’s attention to a terminal in his office linked directly to the reconfigured SDS 930 chugging away on the other side of the continent. Palevsky had not the slightest interest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor judged Palevsky’s knowledge of computing shallow and retrograde. Palevsky grew equally impatient with this government bureaucrat whose technical exuberance clearly outran his commercial sense. Beyond that, he announced that the work done by the vaunted Genie team was “full of holes.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This thing’ll never sell,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor was shaken to the core. For him interactivity was a sacred cause, and for Max Palevsky to stand in its way was intolerable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor felt his old urge rising to establish his primacy in the pecking order. “You’re wasting my time,” he snarled. “Why don’t you get the hell out of here?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He would always cherish his memory of the day he threw Max Palevsky out of his office. But the issue they had so clumsily debated was not closed. A few minutes later Taylor heard someone knock on his door. It was Rigdon Currie, a courtly Georgian who served as Palevsky’s director of sales and marketing. Currie had watched the recent showdown in mounting dismay. One of his responsibilities had been to keep an eye on the Genie team as they transformed the 930. In contrast to his boss, he was deeply impressed by the machine and its commercial potential.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I think Max is wrong,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know he is,” Taylor replied. “What are you going to do about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I think we can turn him around as long as we get people lined up outside his door with money,” Currie said. “Could I bring the customers up here to see your terminal?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You bet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the next few weeks Currie escorted scores of customers up to Taylor’s Pentagon quarters and emerged with more than a dozen solid purchase orders. Palevsky had no choice but to capitulate. He authorized the marketing of the Genie machine as the SDS 940 with one stipulation: SDS was to recover all its development costs from the first three sold. As a result, the 940 was priced at $173,000, about $100,000 more than the base 930, although it carried no more than $5,000 in additional hardware.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The machine became one of the bestselling products SDS ever had, eventually accounting for nearly one-third of its sales. It helped turn time-sharing into a commercially viable business. But Palevsky never fully committed his company to the new venture. Right up until the end, the 940 was manufactured not on a dedicated assembly line, but by trucking conventional 930s to a special plant, where they were torn down and the new hardware installed by hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor won that battle. But his encounters with Max Palevsky were not over, not by a long shot. A few short years later their destinies would converge again—this time in the aftermath of one of the costliest miscalculations any American corporation has ever made. The corporation was Xerox.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">McColough’s Folly</b></p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">N</b>ew Year’s Eve, 1968. From his office on the twenty-eighth floor of Xerox Corporation headquarters in Rochester, New York, Dr. Jacob E. Goldman stared testily out at the filthy weather. Like a prisoner marking off the term of his incarceration on the wall of a cell, he mentally toted up the days since he had seen any trace of the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The number was thirty-one. Since arriving to take up the job of chief scientist at Xerox on the first of December, Jack Goldman had witnessed precipitation in Rochester every single day. He was thoroughly sick of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that inauspicious moment C. Peter McColough, the company’s chief executive, walked in to wish him a happy new year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Peter,” Goldman blurted, “I think I’ve made a great mistake.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s the matter, Jack? Aren’t you happy here?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Peter, look out the window.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Goldman reminded McColough that he had not even had time to move into a proper house. His car spent every night exposed to the elements outdoors, and every morning he wasted a half-hour scraping ice and snow off the windshield. Recently separated and living alone, Goldman even found himself nervously pondering how future candidates for his hand might take to Rochester’s dismal climate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">McColough had to be disconcerted by his chief scientist’s misery, given the trouble he had taken to get Jack Goldman into the corporation. He believed fervently that Xerox, successful as it was, needed to absorb modern technology. The alternative was to risk sinking into oblivion as its products became supplanted by new developments. Hiring Jack Goldman, a visionary technologist and superb judge of research talent at Ford Motor Company, was a critical component of that strategy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But to make way for the new appointee McColough had first had to dislodge the incumbent chief scientist. This was the aging John H. Dessauer, who had held the post for decades. “McColough thought it was time for Dessauer to step down as the chief technical officer of Xerox, make him emeritus, congratulate him and thank him for everything he’s done, and get a hotshot technologist in there in his place,” recalled one executive from that period. “Naturally Dessauer was very reluctant to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That placed McColough, then the Xerox president, in a delicate spot. Goldman refused to consider Xerox’s offer until Dessauer’s retirement was assured. As he bluntly told one corporate headhunter in 1966: “Come back when you’re prepared to offer me his job.” But Dessauer was close to a deity at Xerox. It was he who had inveigled his bosses at modest little Haloid Company into bankrolling the untested duplicating technology of an eccentric inventor named Chester Carlson and shepherded it toward commercialization. He had supervised the design and development of the celebrated Xerox 914 copier, which became the most successful industrial product in history. To put it bluntly, Dessauer was as responsible as any man alive for the fabulous prosperity of what had evolved into Xerox Corporation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To overcome his recalcitrance McColough finally appealed to the lone individual at Xerox occupying an even higher level of divinity: the venerated chairman and chief executive, Joe Wilson. Wilson fully sympathized with McColough’s desire to revitalize Xerox research.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At length the two men came up with a plan to simultaneously announce Wilson’s own retirement as chief executive (although not as chairman), McColough’s
promotion to CEO, and, as part of the changing of the guard, Dessauer’s retirement as chief scientist. Almost no one personified an American corporation as Joe Wilson did Xerox, most of whose employees had never known another CEO. Dessauer could hardly resist such a self-sacrificing scenario. Grumbling to the end, he finally acquiesced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After such maneuvering it would not do for Jack Goldman to get balky after a month on the job. On that snowy New Year’s Eve McColough thought fast. He decided to mollify his new executive by tipping him to one of the two vital corporate secrets he was at that very moment holding close to his vest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Take heart, Jack,” he said. “Things are in the offing. Soon you’ll be thinking more kindly of the outside environment.” Goldman could not guess what exactly McColough had in mind, but the CEO’s portentous manner told him it was something big. In fact, the company was finalizing plans to move its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut. Given Xerox’s stature as a native Rochester institution, this would be momentous news indeed. The relocation would drain the region’s faltering economy of hundreds, maybe thousands, of jobs. Wary of a backlash, McColough had no intention of making the decision public until months more of subtle groundwork could be laid. Appeased by the hint that a favorable change was in the air, even if he could not know what it was, Goldman accepted his boss’s holiday wishes in a much improved temper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was the other secret, the one McColough failed even to hint at that evening, which would wind up exerting a much more powerful force on Xerox’s future—and on Jack Goldman’s. In a series of highly confidential talks, McColough had been negotiating for Xerox to acquire a computer company in Southern California. Less than six weeks into the new year he and its chairman would announce a deal worth nearly one billion dollars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not divulging this secret to his new chief scientist may have been one of the biggest mistakes of Peter McColough’s career. Had he only opened up, Goldman mused later, “I could have led him to knowledgeable people in the computer field. People who would have advised against it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seen another way, however, it was fortunate he did not. For Xerox’s
purchase of Scientific Data Systems—a flagrant miscalculation when considered solely as an act of business strategy—would lead directly to the founding of PARC.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not that Goldman opposed the idea of Xerox getting into digital computing. After all, his responsibility as chief scientist was precisely to introduce novel technologies into a company grown narrow-minded and dull. What concerned him was the way it had been handled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The urge to enter the computer business came from Joe Wilson, who had long expressed apprehension that new technologies might someday render Xerox’s image-to-paper monopoly obsolete. “If we’re going to be big ten or twenty years out,” he once lectured McColough, “we’ve got to be able to handle information in digital form as well as graphic form.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">McColough soon concluded that the best way to join the digital revolution was to buy a piece of it. This effort, however, turned into a long-running comedy. By the end of 1968 there were few computer companies in existence that Xerox had not approached with an acquisition offer. “Peter turned over every rock,” recalled one executive who served on numerous corporate task forces over the course of the saga. “He looked at everybody.” Honeywell, Burroughs, Sperry, Control Data—every leading manufacturer then competing with the redoubtable IBM rebuffed the overture. The one time Xerox found a company eager to sell, it developed cold feet. That happened when General Electric, which had uncharacteristically made a hash of its time-sharing business, offered the operation to Xerox at a bargain price. But GE appeared too desperate a seller. “They kept increasing the discount and making the terms more favorable,” remembered the same executive. “They were trying to give McColough a deal he couldn’t refuse. But it was a hopeless proposition. GE had neither technology nor a cutting-edge business, and we turned them down.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At other points there had been mixed signals and missed opportunities. Xerox made an offer to Ken Olsen, the founder and chairman of Digital Equipment Corporation, the young and aggressive company known as DEC. Olsen’s answer was a flat refusal. Only years later did General
Georges Doriot, one of DEC’s original financiers, inform Goldman that Xerox had approached the wrong person. “Peter was my student at Harvard,” he complained. “He should have known you don’t approach the president on a matter like this. You talk to the backers.” McColough’s wish list eventually dwindled down to a single name: Max Palevsky’s Scientific Data Systems, the same company for which Project Genie had built the SDS 940 a few years earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since bringing out the time-sharing machine SDS had continued to grow amazingly fast. In 1968, the year McColough came knocking, the company booked record profits of $10 million. Yet only someone with McColough’s total lack of understanding of the computer industry could delude himself into viewing SDS as Xerox’s entrée to a bright digital future. For the glittering numbers obscured some gloomy facts. SDS’s success at mining a comfortable niche in scientific computing would not easily transfer to the high-volume business data processing market, the ferociously competitive sector dominated by IBM in which McColough now expected Xerox to play a major role. SDS’s core market, meanwhile, was suffering from a serious economic downturn exacerbated by a drying up of government research funding. And there were nagging questions about the company’s research capabilities and the depth of its management team.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A relentless salesman, Palevsky glided over such details. Privately considering Xerox management ponderous and unimaginative—textbook monopolists destined to be trampled in a competitive market—he gamely assured McColough that their two companies were
“a perfect fit.” The high-speed printing technology SDS owned, combined with Xerox’s experience in making imaging systems (i.e., copiers) and marketing them to large corporations, would create unique new business products to beard IBM in its own lair, he proclaimed. McColough allowed himself to be persuaded that if Xerox wanted in, it had to move fast. SDS, as he later put it, was “the only ballgame left in town.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Had he inquired within his own organization before straying into Palevsky’s lair, he might have been better armed to deal with this master pitchman. Xerox headquarters was equipped with a corps of talented financial experts trained to analyze every major industry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a
corporate rule that no acquisition could ever be considered until a task force placed the target’s books and markets under a microscope and delivered a thoroughly reasoned recommendation to the board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, however, McColough unwisely left the experts at home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It may have been out of an excess of caution: A run Xerox had made at SDS five years earlier had collapsed amid rumors that a Xerox executive had illicitly bought SDS stock in anticipation of the takeover. For whatever reason, under conditions of extreme secrecy and with virtually no backup he met with Palevsky in El Segundo, the industrial hamlet where the modern SDS complex nestled against the boundary line of Los Angeles International Airport, to “dicker about price.” Which side had the upper hand was, in retrospect, crystal clear. McColough, Palevsky recalled later, “was determined to make a deal.” The meetings, he said, “were very, very short. Two half-days were all it took.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">On Monday, February 10, 1969, the two of them announced that Xerox, in the largest transaction it had ever undertaken and one of the largest in American corporate history up to that time, would buy Scientific Data Systems for more than $920 million. McColough’s one-man initiative stunned the investment community. For one thing, he proposed to pay Palevsky in Xerox shares. It was true that the stock was a high-flying favorite on Wall Street—trading at $269
a share, it was cheap currency indeed to spend on an acquisition.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But that did not mean it could not be squandered. Xerox would have to issue nearly 3.5 million new shares to pay for the deal. Max Palevsky would be transformed into Xerox’s single largest stockhold-er in one giant step. Plus he was to be awarded seats on the board of directors for himself, his venture banker Arthur Rock, and two trusted lieutenants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This for a company that had never made more than $10 million in a single year. IBM itself traded for less than half the purchase premium McColough had agreed to pay for a company with one-hundredth of its market share. If things did not pick up at SDS, Xerox’s investment would not be paid off for 92 years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Concerns surfaced immediately that Xerox was buying an empty shell in its desperation to get into the computer business. Top managers were already leaving SDS in droves, many of them retiring on what they had
made from the rise in its stock price over the previous few years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Palevsky himself had openly announced his intention to withdraw from day-to-day management as soon as possible. On the job he was prone to distraction, a dabbler in politics, movies, the peace movement. There was reason to question whether anyone would be left to mind the store.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Back at headquarters Jack Goldman was as shocked by the SDS
deal as everybody else. “I was the head of research for the company,” he said, “but I wasn’t consulted. At all.” He was willing to forgive the slight as the price of being a newcomer, but only up to a point. For his opinion to be overlooked on a major technology venture tasted disagreeably of Xerox’s traditional conception of research: fine in its place, but irrelevant to anything as important as strategic planning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what Goldman could tell, this attitude pervaded the company, to its misfortune. It affected even the kind of research being done at Xerox’s main technical laboratory, a vast installation spread over the Rochester suburb of Webster. At Ford, Goldman’s biggest budgetary headache had been finding money for all the computers the engineers and scientists demanded for their labs, not to mention the outside experts imported by the platoon to help them exploit the new technology in designing cars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nothing of the kind ever occurred at Xerox research. The Webster engineering and research staff treated the new science of computer-aided design with utter indifference. Webster’s classically educated chemists, physicists, and metallurgists devoted their attention to narrow, product-oriented tasks, trying to develop better toners and photoreceptors to drop into copiers designed the same old way. As far as that went they were talented enough, but they had no incentive to keep up with new research techniques. As for applying imagination to an entirely new science, concept, or machine, Webster was hopeless. It was not research as Jack Goldman understood the word; it was product development, which was something very different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Real research people tend to interact with the world at large,” he observed. “They know what’s happening on the university campuses and get invited back and forth, so they become an avenue through which you
can attract new ideas into the company. Research is a funnel through which you can bring in people who normally won’t talk to the guys down in the trenches designing equipment,” he said. Xerox had not been getting new ideas, and it showed. By allowing its researchers to isolate themselves the company had become as musty as a sealed tomb.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Goldman had only agreed to join Xerox because he saw a glimmer of hope in McColough’s forward-looking determination. The gentlemanly Canadian-born executive had lured Goldman away from Ford by pledging to place corporate research on an entirely new footing. Goldman may have felt somewhat out of place at headquarters—short, rotund, and profane, quick-witted and sharp-tongued, and educated at Yeshiva University, he certainly made a contrast to the patrician, Ivy-Leaguish executives that commercial success had attracted the Xerox management cadre. But McColough had promised that as chief scientist he would have the authority to conduct research from the bottom up, following wherever science led him, rather than top-down, which only served the interests of the company’s old guard. That made the offer hard to resist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now Goldman found his confidence shaken. Acquiring a computer manufacturer could have helped inject a new attitude into a Xerox that had devolved from a nimble, innovative risk-taker into a creaking giant. But SDS was not that kind of acquisition. He was appalled at its intellectual conservatism. SDS computers were good enough in their own market, he confided to his colleague George White, but their day had passed. No one would mistake them any longer for leading-edge. “He felt those guys down there in El Segundo were just a bunch of dumbbell copycats as far as technology was concerned,” White recalled. “They were never going to be first on anything that mattered.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet they might serve a subtler purpose. As the SDS purchase moved toward a shareholder vote at the corporate annual meeting in June, Jack Goldman contemplated how to snatch a new opportunity for Xerox from what was already being labeled “Peter McColough’s Folly.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">McColough fought Wall Street’s doubts about SDS with all the rhetoric a corporate chief executive could muster. His waning prestige made it an uphill battle. A year or so earlier he had disgruntled the investment community with an equally headstrong—and unsuccessful—takeover bid for the financial services company CIT. This new transaction revived complaints about his “golf-course” deal-making, a label he detested. SDS was a successful company with its best years still ahead, he asserted. “It had been making profits every year. The growth record was great. The profitability record was great. So we made a deal.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His arguments only incited more skepticism. The growth prospects in SDS’s main lines of business were meager, not great, according to industry analysts whose ardor for the transaction continued to cool. Finally, at a luncheon meeting of New York securities analysts, McColough laid out a grandiloquent vision. It was wrong to look at SDS and Xerox as separate companies, he said. His idea was for SDS to help Xerox expand its rule over the office copier market into the domination of a greater universe—“the office of the future.” The Xerox to come, he declared emphatically, would control “the architecture of information.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The phrase was classic CEO-speak, grave, tendentious, and nebulous enough to be perfectly consistent with any strategy Xerox chose to pursue. McColough later attributed the wording to his speech-writer. Yet for the next decade it would hang in the air like an persistent echo. The architecture of information: The phrase might as well have been chiseled over the doors of the hilltop palace Xerox would soon build to house a group of employees quite unlike any others the company had ever placed on its payroll.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It was a great phrase,” one PARC engineer said later, “because nobody knew exactly what it meant. So there were quite a few interesting things you could do and simply cite that as the justification.” In May the shareholders, accepting on faith McColough’s hazy vision of the future, approved the acquisition of SDS for a final price of $918 million in stock. Xerox owned its computer company. Now it needed to figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is where Jack Goldman stepped in. Six weeks after the annual meeting he delivered to McColough a twenty-one-page proposal, complete with staffing charts and pro-forma budgets looking ahead five years, for a dynamic new scientific facility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The SDS purchase had given him a peg on which to hang the proposal. On the surface the rationale for the so-called “Xerox Advanced Scientific &amp; Systems Laboratory” was to fortify the new subsidiary’s weak research capability. But from that foundation Goldman was intent on building a much larger edifice. Cannily recognizing that Xerox yearned to be ranked alongside such paragons of industrial muscle as IBM and AT&amp;T, he sketched out a corporate research center engaged in basic science independent of any existing product group, exactly like IBM’s fabled Yorktown Heights research center and AT&amp;T’s Bell Laboratories. About half the staff would be devoted to advanced physics and materials research, and the rest to the new sciences of systems and computing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“He was talking about a first-class research facility,” one Webster staff executive of the time recalled later. “Something that would become known worldwide by attracting top scientists doing fundamental research, and maybe winning a Nobel Prize or two.” Goldman therefore associated the lab not only with the immediate needs of SDS but more vaguely with “Xerox’s long-range interests.” The staff would be assigned “to establish scientific preeminence in those disciplines that appear relevant or likely to become relevant.” Even if computer science demanded the lion’s share of attention, Goldman warned that Xerox must learn to expect the unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The use of computers has developed at least as fast as anticipated, but not in the manner anticipated by most prognosticators.” Overall, while encouraging his superiors to believe the new lab sprang logically from Xerox’s existing business strategy, he subtly built a case for using basic research to identify new, unanticipated opportunities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Goldman had often been reproached at Ford for lacking a refined sense of business or commerce. (He never tired of telling the story of how Henry Ford II, witnessing a demonstration of some remarkable but impractical new technology, remarked: “Not much of your stuff gets on a car, does it, Jack?”) He would later face the same criticism at Xerox. Yet his memo glimpsed where computing might lead the company. Among other things, Goldman recognized—significantly ahead of many others in the field—that software would soon outstrip hardware as the driving force of innovation. More important, he saw that it would be the key to Xerox’s ability to profit from the computer’s ability to drive a high-tech printer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Xerox should be the one to revolutionize certain printing functions with a machine which is half xerographic printer and half computing machine,” he wrote, thus anticipating by more than ten years the product with which Xerox would most profitably commercialize the work of PARC: the laser printer. He also accurately forecast burgeoning opportunities in education and graphics long before the hardware existed to run anything even faintly resembling a commercial system.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet it is also evident that Goldman did not fully appreciate the hazards of creating a laboratory almost entirely divorced from the needs of Xerox’s existing businesses. Who could have foreseen the abyss that would alienate one tiny group of sequestered and privileged theoreticians from the thousands of ordinary engineers who faced relentless deadlines to get product out the door? Or perhaps he was merely being disingenuous when he wrote of a systems science laboratory that would “develop rapport with the entire company.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Goldman proposed an ambitious growth plan for the corporate lab. It would open with twenty-five to thirty researchers and a budget of less than $1 million, but equal Webster’s size within about four years with a staff of 300 housed in a seven-million-dollar facility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The operating budget, he forecast, would plateau at about $6 million a year in 1969 dollars. (The figure turned out to be short by a factor of five.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the new lab’s location, he recommended New Haven, which offered Yale University’s “intellectual night life” as a lure for prospective recruits as well as proximity to the new corporate seat in Stamford. “If the new research center is too isolated from Xerox environment and Xerox thinking, the chances of relevant coupling to Xerox’s needs and practices will be severely diminished,” he wrote prophetically. “On the other hand, a site near corporate headquarters has very much to offer in terms of coupling to the full range of future as well as present business interests of Xerox.” The liberal and enterprising Peter McColough was thoroughly enchanted by the notion of a corporate research hermitage. His enthusiasm, however, was not unanimously shared in the top reaches of the company. At the board meeting at which Goldman presented his plans for the new lab, strident opposition arose from an unexpected source: the new board members from SDS.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Max Palevsky balked violently at the idea of dissipating five or six million dollars a year on pie-in-the-sky research. He thought McColough and Goldman, were approaching a serious financial commitment like dilettantes and that their motives were irrelevant to real corporate goals. “The memory I carried away was the number of times IBM came up in the discussions about the research center,” he recalled later. “It was corporate conspicuous consumption. I never got the feeling that the people at Xerox understood that something like this didn’t pay unless you really did basic research like IBM—treat it as a big undertaking that would need years to give you any return.” If Xerox was serious about computer research, he groused, why not simply give the money to SDS? Then the computer division would be able to develop a new version of its Sigma series computer, which had been brought out to supplant the aging 930.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Goldman was disgusted. He replied that the best way to serve SDS interests was to mount an independent, far-reaching effort in basic research, not by financing incremental upgrades for an aging product. “They were the people who could best profit from the research lab, and they were completely disinterested,” he said later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any event, McColough had the necessary authority to green-light the new lab on his own. He had brought Goldman into the meeting as a courtesy to the board, not as a bid for votes. As for the SDS faction, “Peter didn’t pay too much attention to their objections, bless his soul,” Goldman recalled. “But as a matter of record he did not require nor did he ask for board approval.” To Goldman he gave his blessing to establish Xerox’s second full-scale research laboratory on a site to be determined, with the understanding that it was not to outshine in manpower or budget the proud Webster research park outside Rochester. Goldman shrugged at this solitary caveat. According to his master plan, the two labs would be pointed in entirely different directions. Still, there was no question with which one his heart lay. With seed money in his pocket, he set off to build Xerox a shrine to a new science.</p>
