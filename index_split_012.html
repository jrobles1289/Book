<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">D</b>avid Biegelsen’s first impression of PARC almost made him sick to his stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A freshly minted physics Ph.D. from Washington University, Biegelsen had been personally recruited by George Pake in March 1970, when the Porter Drive building was still a littered and empty shell. It had been cleaned up but not filled up by September, when he and his wife arrived to lay eyes on California for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The remodelers had been in, partitioning off the space in the big building so that both sides of the square corridor were lined with (mostly vacant) offices, but the first thing Biegelsen noticed when he walked into the building was its sunlit interior courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The atrium had an olive tree in it and not much else,” he remembered. “But the ground underneath was just covered with olives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought, ‘Wow, this is California, the food is just lying there on the ground!’ I picked one up and put it in my mouth and just about died from the acidity in it. Later I spent hours in the library trying to find out how to cure the things.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was a fair enough introduction to the virtues and challenges of this mysterious place, so new that everyone’s first task was deciding what to do with their freedom. For Biegelsen there was a bittersweet and slightly frightening aspect to the empty offices and the clean slate. It was the trepidation sensed by any pioneer in the split second before he takes his very first step into the unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Here I was fresh out of graduate school and I didn’t have the vaguest idea of what I was to do. I was groping through the insecurity of trying to find something really worthy of this job. But the area was so beautiful, so lush and green, and there was this mixture of wonderful good luck of this really great job and the need to make something happen.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Over the next few months the arrival of more young scientists like himself lent the glass-walled building on Porter a deceptively bust-ling air. In fact, the staffing proceeded slowly, by design. Although the announcement of PARC’s founding had brought in more than 900 resumes in the first few weeks, Pake and Squires took their time making offers. Government funding cuts and the dire economics of the aerospace and defense industries, they figured, were sure to produce a robust supply of gifted candidates. Pake was especially cautious, his ambitions fixed on assembling a cadre of exceptional scientists capable of winning Xerox a Nobel Prize, as Bell Labs had already won two for AT&amp;T. At its six-month anniversary on New Year’s Day 1971, PARC’s staff, including administrators and secretaries, still numbered only twenty-three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The languid pace of recruitment left plenty of time for the ceremonies that often accompany the launch of new corporate ventures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">PARC was formally dedicated at a dinner in October by none other than Peter McColough, who happened to be in California peddling an issue of Xerox bonds to West Coast investors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake was delighted to show off his fledgling research center and its minuscule staff. Jack Goldman flew in for the occasion and invit-ations were dispatched to such Silicon Valley luminaries as Bill Hewlett, the cofounder of Hewlett-Packard, and Stanford President Richard Lyman. Rick Jones ordered a catered dinner and rented extra tables and chairs.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre6">As of 1970. In the subsequent decade Bell Labs scientists won two more.</i> </p>
<p class="calibre2">Then a freak heat wave struck and the temperature settled at a humid 95 degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This meant trouble. The one system not yet operational on Porter Drive was the air conditioning. Envisioning a hundred guests dozing through the ritual speeches and keeling over into their fancy hors d’oeuvres, Jones hastily equipped a couple of workmen with ladders and water hoses and instructed them to cool off the roof while he sped down to San Jose to rent a few big floor fans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time the guests arrived that evening, the building was cool enough for Silicon Valley’s founding generation of high-tech entrepreneurs to mingle comfortably with the freshman class of PARCscientists in the harmony of shared knowledge and ambition. But as the guests moved to the buffet, something made Jones glance up at the ceiling, where a dark stain was spreading among the tiles directly over the buffet table. “My God,” he said to himself, “they forgot to turn off the hoses!” He bolted upstairs to stanch the flow of water while several intrepid guests bore the tables, laden with expensive delicacies, to safety—just before the compromised ceiling started to drip.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally the groaning boards were relocated under a dry area and, disaster averted, Goldman and Pake made their welcoming speeches.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A beaming Peter McColough basked in his newfound reputation as an enlightened technological leader. For the rest of his administration he would think fondly of PARC as one of his finest achievements and Xerox’s crown jewel. It was not an opinion all his successors would share.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the end of 1970, long before PARC reached its full complement of staff, Pake established its long-term organizational structure by subdividing the center into three distinct units. The Computer Science Laboratory had Taylor as acting manager over five scientists, including Jim Curry and Robert Flegal, a pair of graphics specialists he brought along from Utah. The Systems Science Laboratory (SSL), also with five professionals, had been placed temporarily under the management of a reluctant Bill Gunning, who had accepted the job as a stopgap but was anxious to return to hands-on research (a more willing research manager would not be recruited for another two years). The third leg of the structure was the General Science Lab (GSL), the solid-state physics branch nominally headed by Pake. GSL employed four scientists, one of whom, an ex-Webster physicist named Gerald Lucovsky, served under Pake as GSL’s associate manager.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This structure mirrored Pake’s determination to set the new science of computing and the classical science of physics on equal footings, which he believed would encourage the two sides to intermingle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if this dream would never be realized, the optimistic structure endured through the next decade with only minor changes, as when Pake severed the Optical Science Lab from SSL to give its work on laser printing and optical memory technology greater status.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake also established by the close of 1970 a full research agenda.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a corporate memo dated January 4, 1971, he outlined an ambitious program for his group of twenty-three, augmented by another eight or ten professionals due to start work over the following few months.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Systems Science Lab was to take over development of a laser-driven computer printer whose inventor, a Webster engineer, had come west after failing to interest his bosses in its potential. SSL researchers would also investigate optical memories, a technology that would eventually give rise to today’s compact disc and CD-ROM, and speech recognition by computer. Taylor’s Computer Science Lab was to pursue his pet interest in graphics while developing specifications for a basic center-wide computer system. And GSLwas assigned studies in solid-state technologies, including the electrical and optical qualities of crystals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake warned his superiors that under the projected growth curve the Porter Drive complex, which at the time housed everyone comfortably, would certainly burst its seams by the close of 1971. He was too upbeat. In the first weeks of the year Xerox headquarters knocked the staffing projections flat by imposing a company-wide hiring freeze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xerox at that moment was a company in siege mode. Its pattern of consistently rising earnings, virtually unbroken since the introduction of the 914, was cracking. The year just ended had brought a general economic slowdown and, consequently, cutbacks in capital spending by its biggest customers. More troubling, 1970 had also marked the end of Xerox’s monopoly over the copier market. In April IBM had brought out its first office copier. It was a slow, clunky machine that could scarcely match the Xerox line for speed and reliability. But with one of the great names of American industrial muscle behind it, the new entry cast a very menacing shadow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Xerox’s patent was about to expire on its selenium-alloy photoreceptor, the material that lined a revolving drum inside every copier. The selenium was a critical element of xerography. Its electrostatic charge was neutralized by light and preserved by shadow in a way that mirrored the image of a page to be copied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Particles of toner stuck to the charged regions of the drum, which corresponded to dark marks on the original, and could then be transferred to a fresh page to reproduce the image. Although numerous other parts of the process—notably the composition of the toner itself—were still protected by patents or by corporate secrecy, the expiration of the selenium patent demolished one key barrier preventing interlopers from playing in Xerox’s private preserve. IBMused a different process, but others were sure to take advantage of this technological bonus. Eastman Kodak, the company’s Rochester-based big brother, was already known to be working on a rival machine. More ominously, halfway around the world, teams of American, German, and Japanese engineers were developing a small tabletop copier, ultimately to be marketed in the United States as the Savin 750. By offering high-speed office duplication to the millions of midsized and small customers Xerox had always ignored, the Savin would threaten the company’s very survival.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These events kicked off what corporate historians dubbed Xerox’s</p>
<p class="calibre2">“lost decade.” The 1970s, a period of conspicuous creativity at PARC, would be better remembered at headquarters as an era of shriveling market share, financial stagnation, and unceasing litigation over patent and antitrust claims. Presaging the coming storm, the company had missed its revenue and profit targets for November and December 1970. The panicked Stamford headquarters, no longer under the control of the engineers and sales executives of Joe Wilson’s era but of accountants and financial engineers, moved rapidly to rein in spending.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The danger to PARC in this period was even graver than a simple hold on new hiring. Few of its tiny staff ever knew how close the research center came to being exterminated before it even reached puberty. For among the cost-cutting steps the finance-minded executives proposed to the board of directors was the closure or sale of the new Palo Alto facility. There did not seem to be anything to lose or much point in carrying on: The fixed investment was still negli-gible; the buildings leased; the value to Xerox still conjectural. (Had not Pake warned them not to expect a return for at least five years?) But at the last minute one director stood up to interpose his incontestable authority before the hangman. John Bardeen was a towering figure of scientific research, perhaps the most accomplished engineer of his time. In 1971 he already had one Nobel Prize under his belt, for co-inventing the transistor at Bell Labs with William Brittain and William Schockley. (Another would follow in 1972, for his contributions to the theory of superconductivity.) Bardeen crisply informed his fellow directors of his opinion that divesting PARC would be an irresponsibly shortsighted act. Its budget was $1.7 million, barely a flyspeck on the bottom line. By contrast, its potential was limitless. “This is the most promising thing you’ve got,” he said (as Jack Goldman, also a board member, nodded silent and relieved assent). “Keep it!” The center was saved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While that small drama played itself out in Stamford, PARC’s first few recruits got to know each other amid rented furniture and vacant offices. In time the administrative divisions Pake established would congeal into battle lines of contentious perspectives and personalities, but that was still far in the future. “We were all intermingled with each other, so it wasn’t as if one group was in one part of a building and the systems people were in another part and the computer people were in another part,” recalled David Thornburg, who slid in just under the wire of the hiring freeze and arrived for work shortly after New Year’s Day as employee number twenty-five. “We were a small enough group so everyone knew everyone else.” For a glittering instant it seemed as though PARC might fulfill Pake’s dream of a utopia where physicists and computer scientists communed in quest of a common science. They mixed freely in PARC’s small yet somehow all-encompassing world, a place full of possibilities and mysterious conjunctions. Thornburg was still unpacking his things on his very first day when Biegelsen, who on the strength of his three months’ tenure already ranked as a seasoned PARC veteran, showed up at his office door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I just came to introduce you to your next-door neighbor,” Biegelsen said, leading Thornburg into the adjoining warren. “This is George. I thought you guys should get together because you shared a similar research interest in grad school.” Thornburg was perplexed. He understood George to be working on speech recognition and he had come in as a thin-film metallurgist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Really?” the neighbor asked. “What did you do you work in?” That was all the voluble Thornburg needed to set off on a thorough explication of his doctoral career, not excepting the time he had to change themes in midcourse thanks to the preemptive publication of a thesis on the same subject by a guy from Oregon named George White.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m pleased to meet you,” his neighbor said, smiling. “I’m George White.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">What particularly delighted the new staff was the atmosphere of determined informality and lack of pretension. That PARC seemed more like a university department than a corporate research facility was unsurprising, given that most of the staff were being exposed to the nonacademic world virtually for the first time in their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since all but two of the principal scientists (John Urbach, an optical expert from Webster, and Lucovsky) were newcomers to Xerox, Pake and Jones took to sending them on field trips to Rochester, Webster, El Segundo, and the Electro-Optical Systems division in Pasadena, just to give them some feeling for the corporate culture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the center of their existence remained the two buildings on Porter Drive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We would get together once a week and just sort of share what was going on in the lab,” Thornburg recalled. “It became almost a quasisocial event.” PARC was so new that no one had been issued security badges or company identification. With scant equipment of any value on the premises, the building stayed unlocked and hospitable to outsiders. “We were physically adjacent to Stanford University, so there were visitors dropping in and out of the lab all the time. A lot of us even came to feel we were sort of like university instructors who got to spend all our time doing research without having to teach classes. So we operated as though this were an open environment where we were free to share what we were doing with anyone we wanted to.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or occasionally  <i class="calibre6">too</i> free. One morning in early 1971 the weekly meeting was addressed by Jack Goldman, who was in the habit of paying frequent visits to his new incubator. Goldman’s talk—perhaps inspired by PARC’s recent close call—had to do with the need to start generating formal reports and white papers to reassure Stamford that the money being spent out west was buying genuine intellectual achievement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone Thornburg did not recognize interrupted Goldman with a suggestion. “He said, ‘Well, if you ask me, Jack’—the rest of us never called him anything but ‘Dr. Goldman’—‘If you ask me, Jack, what we should do is build a computer-based query system where we can tag the different levels of the report, so somebody who just wants an executive summary could get that and someone who wants more could get the full report.’ He was basically talking about a hypertext-like environment. We were all sitting there thinking this is pretty good stuff, and Goldman was up front, chomping on his cigar, saying ‘Yeah, that’s a good idea.’” The moment the meeting broke up Thornburg saw his friend Bob Bauer shoot out into the hallway. Curious, he followed, and finally found Bauer leaned up against a wall, laughing so hard he could hardly catch his breath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s so funny?” Thornburg asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You know that guy who said, ‘Well, if you ask me, Jack?’”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, who is he?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“He doesn’t work here,” Bauer said. “He just came over from Stanford to have lunch with somebody in computer science. They said, ‘We got a meeting, stick around,’ so he followed them in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Goldman is probably going to want to give him a bonus or something, and the guy doesn’t even work for Xerox!” But the paradise of collegiality was more mythical than real, or at least it was destined to be short-lived. Jack Goldman had not acceded to Pake’s desire to have physicists and other traditional scientists on the premises because he subscribed to any notion of marrying the old science to the new. Instead he saw it as a way to rapidly ramp up PARC’s head count by kidnapping available talent from Webster while recruiting the computer and systems experts he was counting on to make PARC’s reputation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The idea was that when you brought new people in you wanted them to have someone to talk to,” Goldman said. “So we sort of seeded the two scientific departments”—that is, physics and optics—“with people from the company, a few of the shining lights from Rochester who were desirous of moving. They were very good guys and I suffered a certain amount of criticism for taking them away from Webster and essentially lowering the average IQ of the Webster group.” But he sensed that the physicists and computer scientists would end up in a profound philosophical and scientific tug of war. If Pake believed he could paper over such an elemental conflict, Goldman thought, he was mistaken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hiring freeze ended after a couple of months. In that period the downsizing in the research industries had sharply intensified, in part because the Mansfield Amendment restricting Pentagon spending to specifically military research had begun to bite nationwide. Pake and Squires resumed recruiting with the same cautious deliberation as before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a superb buyers’ market for research and engineering talent, PARC’s lavish budget and open-ended charter stood alone among corporate entities. Other industrial research centers might enjoy generous funding or comparably liberal charters, but none had both the open checkbook and apparent immunity from product development pressures enjoyed by PARC. From the point of view of the nation’s outstanding computer research scientists, Xerox—outside of a handful of top universities—was the only game in town. “All the super-bright guys who had swell ideas were tickled pink to go work for George Pake and Jack Goldman,” recalled George M. White, the research executive on Goldman’s staff. “Nobody was going to float money and start a company for them, like</p>
<p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre6">No relation to George White, the PARC researcher.</i> they would today. At PARC they could get a good budget and a good lab and independence, all of which Pake and Goldman provided.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Adding to PARC’s charm was its premium pay scale. This was partially the result of shrewd entreaties to corporate management by Pake, who feared that Xerox policy requiring PARC’s salary scale to match Webster’s, dollar for dollar, would allow the most prestigi-ous universities to outbid PARC for the best talent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake urged Jack Goldman to secure PARC a dispensation on the grounds that computer scientists were a different breed from the physicists and chemists of Webster. For one thing they were compar-atively scarce. In 1970 a mere handful of academic institutions offered graduate programs in computer science. The congressional restrictions on ARPA grants foretold that the number would stay small and the inventory of first-class graduates thin. At length Goldman secured a differential for computer science Ph.D.s of 15 to 20 percent over Webster scale. That helped PARC secure the best recruits, but had the predictable side effect of generating resentment among the General Science Lab’s physicists and optical scientists, who were excluded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Henceforth PARC could offer people with advanced computer science degrees or working experience in the field starting salaries between $30,000 and $35,000—excellent pay for Ph.D.s at the time, although the range remained wide and often depended on a recruit’s worldliness and bargaining skills. Some from Stanford University, which was known for its stinginess with salaried professionals, got low-balled. One recalled accepting a full-time PARC salary of $24,000, which was at the low end of pay for principal researchers in the computer lab but a big step up from the $16,000 he had earned at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As though to foreshadow the shoals ahead, it was Taylor’s pay that caused Pake the biggest headache. Despite his lack of formal credentials Pake had rostered him on the payroll as associate manager of the Computer Science Lab and, more formally, as area manager of computer graphics within CSL. The starting salary for an area manager in PARC’s order of battle was $44,000, off the scale for a non-Ph.D. anywhere at Xerox. “I had to fight with Goldman and he had to fight with headquarters to get that, because Taylor had only a master’s degree in psychology and it didn’t look right,” Pake said. “Of course, I could understand the bureaucratic problems with that myself.” It was not only Taylor’s lack of credentials that made his salary a sore point. Within months of his arrival at PARC his personality started to grate on the other lab managers, who understandably took exception to his attitude that PARC’s sole  <i class="calibre6">raison d’être</i> was to pursue computer research and that anything spent on the hard sciences was by definition money down a rathole.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A man who would never tolerate personal attacks at his ARPA conferences, Taylor seemed to tack treacherously close to the  <i class="calibre6">ad ho-minem</i> at PARC management meetings. The other lab managers were particularly appalled by his treatment of Gunning, a warm and charming individual who had spent almost as many years in the electronics industry as Taylor had spent on Earth. “He treated Gunning with the utmost condescension,” Jones recalled. “It really created a lot of strife. Bill would say something and Bob would come out with, ‘That’s stupid!’ or, ‘I’m just wasting my time in here!’ It was very unprofessional, and not at all the general atmosphere everyone was used to.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before the year was out a delegation of several middle managers marched into Pake’s office to demand Taylor be fired for his behavior. On this occasion, Pake demurred. He was no more charmed by Taylor than they, but he was more acutely aware of the man’s uncommon value to the organization. The Taylor who had spun a web of carefully nurtured loyalties among the nation’s best young computer researchers seemed an entirely different character from the one who so charmlessly provoked his peers and superiors. The bottom line was that no one could match his ability to lure research talent to PARC; virtually everyone hired thus far into the Computer Science Lab was someone who knew and respected him personally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake felt there were many more gifted scientists yet to be snagged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was right about that. Toward the end of 1970 Taylor called in some of his old chits to stage a pair of dazzling heists.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first was a raid on the only laboratory on the West Coast—possibly the country—whose work on interactive computing met his stern standards. The lab belonged to the legendary engineer Douglas C.  bart, an adamantine visionary who held court out of a small think tank called SRI, or the Stanford Research Institute, a couple of miles north of Palo Alto in the community of Menlo Park.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There Engelbart had established his “Augmentation Research Center.” The name derived from his conviction that the computer was not only capable of assisting the human thought process, but reinventing it on a higher plane. The “augmentation of human intellect,” as he defined it, meant that the computer’s ability to store, classify, and retrieve information would someday alter the very way people thought, wrote, and figured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Engelbart’s vision refined and expanded a concept memorably set forth by Dr. Vannevar Bush, an MIT engineering dean and wartime science advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1945 Bush had turned his attention to the scientific advances produced in the name of war and to how they might serve the peace. The result was a small masterpiece of scientific augury entitled “As We May Think,” which appeared in the July 1945 issue of  <i class="calibre6">The Atlantic Monthly</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As We May Think” remains one of the few genuinely seminal documents of the computer age. Even today it stands out as a work of meticulous scientific and social analysis. The contemporary reader is struck by its pragmatism and farsightedness, expressed without a hint of platitude or utopianism, those common afflictions of writing about the future. Bush was not interested in drawing magical pictures in the air; he was busy scrutinizing the new technologies of the postwar world to see how they might relieve society’s pressing burdens.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His essay dealt chiefly with technology’s ability to manage information. Bush discerned the birth of what would come to be called the</p>
<p class="calibre2">“information glut” and projected it forward to a cacophonous posterity. “Publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record,” he wrote. “The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the moment-arily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Himself the inventor of a successful analog computer, Bush understood that computer technology might help society draw sense out of the chaos. He sketched out something called the “memex,” which he described as “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.” The mechanism of consultation would be “associative indexing…whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex.” Doug Engelbart first encountered Bush’s memex in a magazine article he found in an a Red Cross library in Manila, where he was awaiting transport home from his World War II service. He succumbed to the author’s vision of a world of interlinked data as though to a sorcerer’s spell. By the time he left Berkeley a few years later with a Ph.D. in engineering, he had decided that his mission in life would be, in effect, to turn the memex into reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the event, he went far beyond anything Bush himself had imagined. At SRI he propagated from Bush’s rough blueprint a full-blown system of interactive hardware and software aimed at managing, manipulating, and communicating text and video images.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The achievement was all the more remarkable given that it involved an uphill battle against nearly universal skepticism. More than once Engelbart’s thinly financed project narrowly eluded extermination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gradually, however, he acquired a sizable coterie of young engineers and scientists who felt their lives altered by their first meetings with the charismatic Doug Engelbart and who regarded his vision with an almost religious awe. “He not only made sense,” recalled Bill Duvall, one of the early disciples. “It was like someone turning on a light. Love at first sight is perhaps the wrong term to use, but it was as close to that as you can get.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">One other individual entranced by Engelbart’s work was Bob Taylor. At NASA in 1963 Taylor had saved Engelbart’s lab by scrounging enough money to overcome a budget crisis. After moving on to ARPA he turned the trickle of funding into a flood. By the end of the decade the Augmentation Research Center, fueled by ARPA’s half-million-dollar annual grant and occupying one entire wing of SRI’s Menlo Park headquarters, reigned as the think tank’s dominant research program.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What it produced was nothing short of astonishing. Obsessed with developing new ways for man and computer to interact, Engelbart linked video terminals to mainframes by cable and communicated with the machines via televised images. To allow the user to move the insertion point, or cursor, from place to place in a block of text instantaneously, he outfitted a hollowed-out block of wood with two small wheels fixed at right angles so it could be rolled smoothly over a flat surface. The wheels communicated their motion to poten-tiometers whose signals in turn were translated by the computer into the placement of the cursor on the screen. From this crude device would spring an entire culture. “No one is quite sure why it got named a ‘mouse,’” Engelbart said years later. “None of us thought that the name would have stayed with it, out in the world.” The entire interactive system—mouse, screen, computer, software, and underlying philosophy—was known by the acronym “NLS,” for</p>
<p class="calibre2">“oNLine System.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until 1968 Engelbart and his aides labored in relative obscurity, their work known only within the insular fraternity of government grantmakers and computer theorists. That year he requested ninety minutes to demonstrate NLS at the Fall Joint Computer Conference of two leading engineering societies, scheduled for San Francisco in December. The result was one of the most famous events in computing history.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The mouse, making its first public appearance, was the least of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Engelbart and his sixteen assistants stretched existing electronic technology nearly to the breaking point. He recalled later: “We built special electronics that picked up the control inputs from my mouse, keyset, and keyboard and piped them down to SRI [that is, Stanford Research Institute] over a telephone hookup. We leased two mi-crowave lines up from our laboratory, roughly thirty miles. It took two additional antennas on the roof at SRI, four more on a truck on Skyline Boulevard, and two on the roof of the conference center. It cost money…The nice people at ARPA and NASA, who were funding us, effectively had to say, ‘Don’t tell me!’” The effort was worth every penny. The audience was riveted, as Engelbart in his subdued drone described and demonstrated a fully operational system of interactive video conferencing, multimedia displays, and split-screen technology. </p>
<p class="calibre2">At one point half of a twenty-foot-tall projection screen was occupied by a live video image of Engelbart on stage, the other half by text transmitted live from Menlo Park (it was a shopping list including apples, oranges, bean soup, and French bread). Minutes later the screen carried a live video image of a hand rolling the unusual</p>
<p class="calibre2">“mouse” around a desktop while a superimposed computer display showed how the cursor simultaneously and obediently followed its path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The  <i class="calibre6">piece de resistance</i> was Engelbart’s implementation of the memex. The screen showed how a user could select a single word in a text document and be instantly transported to the relevant portion of a second document—the essence of hypertext, found today, some thirty years later, on every World Wide Web page and countless word-processed documents. At the conclusion of the bravura performance Doug Engelbart, previously a prophet without honor, was rewarded with a standing ovation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In 1971 Taylor, whose ARPA funds had helped pay for that demo, was intent on somehow importing Engelbart’s interactive vision into PARC. The only question was how to do it without also importing Doug Engelbart. The problem was that the master’s inspirational dreams were inseparable from his inflexible and self-righteous disposition. One admirer called him “a prophet of biblical dimensions,” a role he fit down to his physical appearance. Tall and craggy, with deepset eyes and a hawklike nose, he might have been carved from a slab of antediluvian granite. Soft-spoken but intransigent, his years of battling unbelievers had convinced him that he was fated to remain the solitary leader of a devoted cadre.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time Taylor was poised to strike, that cadre was showing signs of serious discontent. As the novelty of his ideas wore off (to be fair, this was a process that could take several years), some disciples started to discern the drawbacks of working for so uncompromising a boss—particularly one whose tendency to oracular pronouncements required a stratum of top assistants to periodically sit the rest of the staff down and explain what Doug had in mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Engelbart’s self-defined mission was not to produce a product, or even a prototype; it was an open-ended search for knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Consequently, no project in his lab ever seemed to come to an end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whenever one approached a milestone he would abruptly redefine it, condemning the lab to months or years of further work. The finish line was constantly receding, like the oasis in a desert mirage. Said one long-term member of his lab: “We were like rats running in his maze.” The first to defect was William K. English, a brilliant engineer who had been with Engelbart almost from the start, joining him in 1962as his hardware ace and all-around major-domo. Wiry and deliberative, Bill English had been the invisible guiding hand behind the 1968 demo. He was ferociously loyal to his boss but bridled at the lab’s perpetual lack of closure. Some also believed he was fed up with Engelbart’s way of monopolizing credit for the lab’s accomplish-ments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor offered English a solution to both complaints: reproduce NLS, or something like it, at PARC. English could thus fulfill his treasured goal of bringing the system to commercial fruition  <i class="calibre6">and</i> be in charge of his own lab, out from under the shadow of the implacable Engelbart. Whether English hesitated leaving the leader he had followed for nearly a decade is hard to say, but he continued the raid where Taylor left off, eventually recruiting a dozen of Engelbart’s most important followers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a team they infused Engelbart’s principles into PARC like apostles spreading religion. Thanks to them, the Augmentation Research Center left its indelible stamp on almost every major innovation to emerge from PARC in the next decade. Yet this triumph was not without its painful ironies. English’s reworked version of NLS, the direct descendant of Vannevar Bush’s vision and Engelbart’s work, would be remembered chiefly as PARC’s biggest failure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The agents of its ruin, as it happened, came to PARC via Bob Taylor’s second great heist. Taylor knew that up in Berkeley a handful of extraordinarily talented engineers were about to lose their jobs. In his view PARC could scarcely exist without them. Toward the end of 1970, with George Pake’s approval, he took the necessary steps to reel them in. </p>

<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Berkeley’s Second System</b></p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">T</b>he year 1968 was not a tranquil one for Berkeley, California. It was the time of riots on Telegraph Avenue, the battle over People’s Park, and the calling out of the National Guard by Governor Ronald Reagan. Buildings on the University of California campus were occupied, barricaded, firebombed. The police oscillated between paralysis and overreaction. Turmoil and radicalism were in the air, along with tear gas and a mysterious white powder dropped from helicopters that made demonstrators’ skin itch and burn as though attacked by hornets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The owners of Berkeley Computer Corporation thought it wise to lay low. Radical groups of the time manifested a distinctly Luddite streak, and computer facilities were prominent targets—witness the bombing by one anti-government group of the Army Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, which cost a young physicist his life. UC Berkeley seemed a good bet for much of the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Berkeley Computer therefore inconspicuously spread itself out over the city in three separate locations. One building housed the programmers. Then there was what Chuck Thacker remembered as</p>
<p class="calibre2">“a somewhat more shoddy place where the hardware people lived, essentially a walkup above a warehouse on Sixth Street.” The third was a nondescript edifice a few blocks further along Sixth, a few miles from the campus and not far from the waterfront, in which they were actually building the machine they thought would make their fortune. Thacker recalled: “We found a concrete building that was the fur storage vault for a warehouse, except the warehouse had burned down around the vault. So here was this block structure, two stories, about fifty feet on a side, just a big concrete tube really. When we first saw the place it was filled with two million plastic champagne corks.” After they cleared out the corks and fitted out the building to be even more nondescript, he said, “You’d drive by on the street and never know what it was.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Inside this prosaic structure worked some of the most creative computer designers alive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The team had taken several years to coalesce. Although incorporated in 1968, BCC’s roots reached back to Project Genie, the ARPA time-sharing scheme that designed the 940 computer for Max Palevsky’s SDS. One could even date the company’s spiritual birth to a day in 1964 when a graduate student named Butler Lampson passed through an unmarked door on the Berkeley campus and found Peter Deutsch on the other side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The son of foreign service parents, Lampson had come to study physics at Berkeley with a first-class undergraduate pedigree from Harvard and a reputation for being preternaturally smart. He was rail-thin and stood a little over six feet, with a loping gait that made him seem taller. His manner of speaking was fleet but cogent, unless he was in the grip of some particularly compelling idea, in which case his thought system would rush ahead of his speech processes and he would stumble over his words until his mouth caught up to his brain. When all the inputs and outputs were synchronized, it often seemed as if his mind worked about a thousand times faster than anyone else’s. (“We can now appreciate that in spoken discourse the theoretical speed limit is the  <i class="calibre6">Lampson</i>,” Wes Clark famously cracked at a professional conference a few years later following one of his customarily breakneck presentations.) Sharp as he was, however, even Butler Lampson was a little daunted by the challenge of physics at Berkeley. Later he claimed that he transferred into computer science because it was “not as hard” as physics, but he scarcely meant it the way normal persons do. He meant he found the task of advancing a science that history’s greatest intellects had been mining for 300 years fundamentally uninteresting. Especially when a brand-new field beckoned in which every new discovery represented a terrific leap forward in human enlightenment. So he was primed for the challenge when a friend he ran into at a computer conference in San Francisco asked how things were going across the bay with Project Genie.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lampson returned a blank look. “I’ve never heard of it,” he admitted. He left the party with a description of an intriguing study of computer architectures, along with directions to a building located at the far northeast corner of the Berkeley campus. A few days later he found himself standing on the ground floor of Cory Hall, facing an unmarked door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even in 1964 one could hardly fault the Genie people for their circumspection; the project was funded by the Defense Department.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand there was a limit to paranoia, even at Berkeley.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The unmarked door was unlocked. Lampson pushed it open and walked in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He might have stepped into the lair of the White Rabbit. It was a big room, mostly empty. On one side stood a Bendix LGP30 computer, a massive and obsolete digital machine serving no purpose he could discern. Facing the Bendix was a much smaller Scientific Data Systems 930, a rugged computer of fairly recent vintage. In a swivel chair parked by the 930 sat a short, pudgy, barefooted human being with a mane of black hair and a dense beard, serenely feeding a paper tape into a computer input. The paper tape was not very long and Lampson watched as the stranger fed it in all the way and then, oddly, took it out and fed it back in again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lampson could no longer stifle his curiosity. “That’s weird,” he said. “Why did you just do that?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a two-pass relocatable loader!” the man said without looking up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But that’s ridiculous!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know! I know!” was the impatient reply. “I’m rewriting it!” To an outsider the conversation might have sounded like something out of the Theatre of the Absurd. But as speakers of a shared technical language, the two men understood each other as clearly as fellow initiates to the Masonic mysteries. The two-pass relocatable loader did exist and it was a kludge: an inefficient, overelaborated piece of machinery that had been poorly designed by the machine’s manufacturer. And it did require the programmer to input a paper tape twice in succession because on each sequence the computer could only glean half the information it needed to function.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lampson recognized the system as a waste of time and energy and appreciated at a glance that the man at the console possessed the inborn skill to redesign it so the damn machine would actually learn something new, like how to absorb all the necessary data on a single pass of the tape. His name was Peter Deutsch. He and Lampson would work side by side for the better part of the next twenty years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were an unlikely pair, one of many that would later give PARC its unique character. Lampson’s patrician bearing left people with the impression that he was contemplating science from a great metaphorical height. Deutsch was a white tornado, impatient, perpetually chafing to get his hands on the next arcane programming task. As fast as Lampson’s mind grasped concepts and principles, it worked faster when interacting with the people around him (usually attempting to convince them he was right). Deutsch seemed to prefer unraveling the riddles of computer programming in communion with himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The emblematic image of the gifted Deutsch was a photograph taken of him as a preadolescent. It showed him writing a program for the world’s first minicomputer, a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1, perched on a chair padded with a cushion or phone book so he could reach the keyboard. By then he was already a master of the occult art of computer programming, which he began to learn at the age of twelve when his father, an MIT physicist, brought home a manual for the campus Univac 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The manual covered the Univac’s assembly code, a system of symbolic statements which engineers used as building blocks to write programs for the machine. “Somehow it struck a spark,” Deutsch remembered. “I said I wanted to meet the person who wrote that manual and my father arranged it. He was a person named Lanza, and he actually found a small computational program that needed coding and asked if I wanted to do it. I said sure. I still don’t know what the pro- gram computed, whether he trusted the answers he got out of it, or anything else about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it started him hanging around the Univac, as well as other mainframe computers to which his father’s connections got him access. The grad student programmers in the computer center became accustomed to (if not necessarily patient with) this diminutive soul peppering them with impertinent questions about their work. The wiser among them may even have realized that it would not be long before  <i class="calibre6">they</i> were asking  <i class="calibre6">him</i> questions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soon he was cadging stray time in half-hour segments from the supervisors with the understanding that if anyone came along with serious work, he would get bumped. By the time the university acquired its PDP-1, he had matured into an adept and dexterous programmer with the instincts of an artist. After he moved to Berkeley for his undergraduate education, he would still drop in at MIT now and then during vacations to visit his father and dash off a few lines of code. Students would literally ransack the wastebaskets to read what he had discarded with the hope of absorbing a trace of his inventive technique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still a Berkeley freshman, Deutsch had been involved with Genie only a few months when he was encountered by Butler Lampson.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He explained that Genie’s goal was to refashion the SDS 930 into a small-scale time-sharing machine and that it was run out of the electrical engineering department by David Evans and Mel Pirtle—the first an unassuming computer science professor who limited himself as much as possible to such tasks as raising grant money from the government, the second a garrulous Californian graduate student who designed the hardware.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lampson felt irresistibly drawn to this remote corner of the university campus. “I found out from Peter what was going on, then I started to hang around there a lot,” he recalled. “After a while it became clear that this was going to be a lot more interesting than physics.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Lampson on board, Genie picked up momentum. The group tore apart the SDS 930, tacked on new hardware, and wrote an entirely new operating system. “There weren’t any spectacularly new ideas in the project,” Lampson said later. “The point was to try to take ideas that other people had, some of which had been implemented on other machines, and show you could make it all work in a much less grandiose environment.” Genie accomplished its goal, which was to bring time-sharing to the masses by implementing it on the small machine that Taylor and Currie eventually beguiled Palevsky into marketing as the SDS 940.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Genie team then turned to the eternal question of what to do for an encore. They were a powerful group of talents, especially after Deutsch and Lampson, as good at designing and debugging operating systems as anyone in the field, were joined by Chuck Thacker, whose hardware skills represented the third side, so to speak, of a very sturdy triangle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Growing up poor and fatherless in a suburb of Los Angeles, Thacker had paid his way through school with a succession of jobs at small local engineering shops, including one that made the devices Civil Defense would use to measure ground radiation after the Bomb dropped. (This was the 1950s, after all.) He had always been an electronics nut—he could still remember the day he acquired his very first transistor as a schoolboy—but it was from these shirt-sleeved shop men that he learned to pare a decent design into a manufacturable one by stripping it down to its frugal essence. “They were the real engineer’s engineers,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At Caltech, where he made a short and unsuccessful first run at obtaining a bachelor’s degree, physics was divided into two distinct parts. There was the theory side, which involved a lot of math and cosmological speculation, and what Thacker called “the giant tinker toy side,” which involved building immense, elaborately engineered structures like synchrotrons and cyclotrons. That was the part he loved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, Thacker was animated by the same love of gadgetry that lured countless other physicists like himself into computing. When he moved north to Berkeley to get away from the L.A. smog and give his faltering academic career a fresh start, he fell in among the computing crowd, a course that led him inexorably to the same unmarked door Lampson had discovered a few months earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now it was 1968. Work on the 940 had ended and Dave Evans had relocated to the University of Utah, leaving Pirtle and the others to think about working on a much larger canvas than the 940—a time-sharing system, for example, that would serve not a dozen but 500users at a time. They imagined a machine with several processors, each assigned a specific task and all interconnected, like the tentacles of mating octopuses. It was huge, exciting, innovative, and envisioned not as an academic or government-funded venture, but strictly as a commercial one. Thus was Berkeley Computer Corporation born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although BCC was based on speculative technology, its financial structure appeared at first glance to be made of sterner stuff. Pirtle had arranged through his Wall Street connections to secure $2 million in financing from a company called Data Processing Financial and General, underwritten by the white-shoe investment firm of White, Weld &amp; Co. That sounded like plenty, but it was only seed money.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The team figured that bringing the Berkeley 1 computer to market would consume that sum many times over, which meant they would have to become very familiar with the demands of bankers and the intricacies of high finance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This was definitely not your two-guys-in-a-garage startup,” said Lampson, who by now held a faculty appointment at Berkeley and set his own name down as a cofounder. It was, however, something infinitely more risky. The BCC pioneers were about to become victims of the “second-system effect.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The theory of second systems was formulated by an IBM executive named Frederick Brooks, whose career supervising large-scale software teams taught him that designers of computer systems tend to build into their second projects all the pet features that tight finances or short deadlines forced them to leave out of their first. The result is an overgrown, inefficient monstrosity that rarely works as expected. As he put it in his pithy masterpiece,  <i class="calibre6">The Mythical Man-Month</i>:</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs.” The BCC machine could have sprung full-blown from the pages of Brooks’s text. As Lampson recalled, the designers of the economical and practical SDS 940 regarded their next machine as an opportunity to “look at all the things you could make much more wonderful, and plan to make them all more wonderful by creating a system that could handle a lot more users and much larger programs and was much faster and used computing resources much more efficiently and was better and more wonderful in every possible way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It was not a very realistic enterprise,” he acknowledged. “But at the time it seemed great, the proper next step, as second systems often do.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their exuberance made Berkeley Computer, by all accounts, a jolly place to work, its scientists and engineers propelled by pure hubris into working the kind of inhuman hours that would become a Silicon Valley cliché—when Silicon Valley came into its own fifteen years later. They believed they were breaking new ground in computer design, and they were right. Among other things, their machine incorporated “virtual memory,” a system for swapping jobs from disk to memory and back again that enabled it to accommodate much more activity than its physical specifications otherwise would, like a house with the exterior dimensions of a bungalow but the interior floor plan of a regal palace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In hardware terms, however, the machine was a beast. “The machine consisted of a number of specialized processors, one to handle the disk and drum input/output system, one to handle communications, and one to handle job scheduling,” recalled Thacker, who designed them. “And these things cooperated with two processors which were somewhat larger, which were the central processors for the machine which actually ran the user jobs.” The processors all had to be physically connected to each other and also to the memory, which required a couple of miles of cable snaking among eight six-foot-tall cabinets full of equipment, and then out to peripherals such as teletypes and line printers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some of the workers, including Thacker, could tell early on that the project was getting out of hand. The engineer’s engineer possessed the unique trait of aiming for less, not more, in his systems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This was so unusual for an engineer,” recalled Charles Simonyi, a young immigrant from communist Hungary who assisted Thacker, watching as he chain-smoked through the night designing the machine’s logic. “He had this word for what was happening. He called it ‘biggerism.’ I heard this word from him and my English was not that good and I always thought it sounded slightly obscene, because he’d say, you know, ‘This project has been biggered.’” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Adding to the challenge, the hardware comprised an unwieldy mix of ancient and modern components. The processors were built using a brand-new, and far from bug-free, technology known as TTL (for “transistor-transistor logic”). But the read-only memory, which carried the machine’s basic operating code, was an array of diodes soldered onto some 20 circuit boards—hundreds of thousands of tiny diodes each representing a digital bit. Editing the operating code during the debugging phase, Simonyi recalled, meant finding the errant diode on a foot-square circuit board, clipping it by hand with a die cutter, then drilling new holes and soldering a fresh diode in place. It was like editing text with a hammer and chisel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More problems cropped up in designing the operating system. In computing, economies of scale often work in reverse: As a system grows larger it becomes exponentially more complicated. A computer designed to serve fifty users is not ten times more complicated than a machine for five users, but one hundred times, or a thousand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Berkeley’s 500-user machine proved more complex than even this exquisitely talented team could handle. As Frederick Brooks would have predicted, when they finally got it working it did not work perfectly—and never well enough for the rated capacity of 500 users.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The full-bore crash of expectations, however, came late in the company’s life cycle. For the first year or two BCC’s fortunes resembled the rising curve of an arc. The company ramped up employment to more than 100 hardware and software engineers. The prototype’s name got upgraded from the Berkeley 1 to the Berkeley 500, the better to express their confidence in its capacity (and, as Lampson said, “for marketing purposes”)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pirtle had an artful way of squelching any doubts that might arise about the program. One recruit, an engineer named Ed Fiala who came from the Boston engineering firm of Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, had taken the precaution of ordering a Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit report on BCC before deciding whether to accept the job. “It said, ‘Well, they’re paying their bills but we don’t exactly know how,’” Fiala recalled. He stifled his misgivings and moved to Berkeley anyway, arriving on a night when BCC was having a big party. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“Everybody was all smiles and enthusiasm, and I asked Mel Pirtle how the company was doing,” Fiala recalled. “He said, ‘We’re doing great!’ I was a little concerned. I asked, ‘What sort of financing do you have?’ He said, ‘Oh, we have lots. We just got three hundred thousand dollars.’ And I asked how long that would last and he said, ‘Six weeks.’</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, three hundred thousand dollars sounded like a lot of money to me but the six weeks didn’t seem all that long. So I said,</p>
<p class="calibre2">‘Isn’t that a lot less time than it’s going to take you to complete your project?’ He said, ‘Well, yes…but we can always get more money.’” For a while that was true. Backers touring the BCC quarters invariably came away convinced by the staff’s high spirits that everything was on track. (“I know I tried to look enthusiastic,” Fiala said.) But in 1970 the well ran dry. Not only had the recession dug in, but the technological risks confronted so cavalierly by BCC and other time-sharing companies turned out to be tougher than anyone expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were new questions about whether the machine would ever get done, and who would buy it if it did. Pirtle started to pare staff.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Early in the year he placed those who were left on half salary and advised everyone to look for work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Around then Bob Taylor made his first appearance on the premises. To the younger programmers he cut quite the intriguing figure, a natty, self-assured individual to whom Pirtle and Lampson seemed to pay an unusual degree of respect—even deference. “I didn’t know what to make of him,” said Simonyi, still a cultural innocent living hand-to-mouth as a Berkeley undergraduate while working part-time at BCC. “I had this impression of a laid-back Playboy type, a Hugh Hefner type, good looking, good dresser, athletic, with the pipe of course, always with the pipe. Taylor never had the airs of the false technical B.S. artist. It was a plus that he didn’t, but at the same time I had to ask myself: ‘If he’s not technical, not a technical B.S.’er, then what the hell is he?’” The answer was: A man energetically pursuing a deal. Having alerted Pake to BCC’s financial problems and the likelihood of a rare cache of first-rank talent hitting the market, his initial idea was for Xerox to buy BCC outright and fold it whole into PARC, like a fresh egg into raw batter. That way PARC would acquire an advanced time-sharing prototype along with at least twenty top people and a sizable complement of junior staff. Negotiations with Pirtle along those lines proceeded into the fall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But whether because Pirtle quoted too high a price or BCC failed too rapidly, the wholesale deal collapsed in favor of a sort of  <i class="calibre6">à la</i> <i class="calibre6">carte</i> arrangement. Just as BCC filed for bankruptcy (one final drunken party on Friday, November 13, 1970, drained the last of its petty cash), PARC hired six of its best people—Lampson, Thacker, Deutsch, Fiala, a hardware designer named Richard Shoup, and a software programmer named Jim Mitchell. Pirtle was not interested in coming along. Instead he took over the management of a colossal government project to build the world’s first parallel-architecture supercomputer, the Illiac IV, at NASA’s Ames Research Center in neighboring Mountain View (although some thought that the real reason was that he knew he would never get along with Taylor).</p>
<p class="calibre2">Simonyi went with him, for the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Berkeley 500, the only machine of its kind ever built, was purchased by ARPA on Taylor’s recommendation and shipped to the University of Hawaii to allow that institution to join the ARPANET. The last employees of Berkeley Computer got it up and running in the cavernous building on Sixth Street, then watched with bittersweet emotions as it got crated up. “It was a very complex and interesting project,” Fiala mused later. “It would have been fun to work on it for five years.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Virtually at a single stroke, Taylor had completed his team—almost. He had the best hardware man (Thacker), the best designer of operating systems (Lampson), and an entire cell of other computer science prodigies. PARC was missing only one thing: a philosopher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For there was still the obstacle that among the leading computer experts in the country, including those now on his payroll, very few agreed with him that the goal of computer design was to create a personal machine that interacted with the user via a high-powered display. The BCC group, deeply rooted in the culture of time-sharing, was still intent on getting as many users hooked into a single machine as tech— nologically possible. That goal, as Wes Clark contended, remained incompatible with giving the individual the kind of speed and responsiveness that interactivity required. When Taylor tried to explicate his notion of a display-based user interface, they tuned him out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They would not come around to his point of view for nearly two years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But one man was way ahead of them all. That one had written a doctoral thesis at Utah in 1969 describing an idealized interactive computer called the FLEX machine. He had experimented with powerful displays and with computers networked in intricate configurations. On page after page of his dissertation he lamented the inability of the world’s existing hardware to realize his dream of an interactive personal computer. He set before science the challenge to build the machine he imagined, one with “enough power to out-race your senses of sight and hearing, enough capacity to store thousands of pages, poems, letters, recipes, records, drawings, animations, musical scores, and anything else you would like to remember and change.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">To Taylor he was a soulmate and a profound thinker, capable of seeing a computing future far beyond anything even he could imagine. Among the computer scientists familiar with his ideas, half thought he was a crackpot and the other half a visionary. His name was Alan Kay. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Chapter 6"><b class="calibre4" id="toc_2">CHAPTER 6</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">“Not Your Normal Person” </b></p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">T</b>he hallmark mop of shaggy black hair is shot with gray, but as he nears a quite implausible sixty years of age, little else has changed. Certainly not the energy level, or the sneakers, so characteristic of his working uniform, or the unceasing effulgence from his mind of historical observation, moral instruction, and technological vision.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Conversations with Alan Kay aren’t about any particular thing,” says Carver Mead, a Caltech professor who developed the technology of complex integrated circuits at PARC. “They’re more a ramble through Ideaspace.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ideaspace Central today is divided between two Southern California locations about ten miles apart. One is Kay’s home in an affluent part of Los Angeles. It is unassuming from the outside except for a towering V-roofed addition. This curious annex was custom-built to shelter a two-story pipe organ professionally hand-crafted of exquisite blond spruce, on which Kay can be heard almost any morning practicing his favorite music by Buxtehude and J. S. Bach. (“Alan believed his role was to make it possible to build the organ, after which he would be the happy caretaker,” remarked its architect, Greg Harrold.) </p>
<p class="calibre2">The second location is a warehouse-like building in Glendale, a smoggy precinct of the San Gabriel Valley just north of L.A. Artfully arranged partitions and bookcases provide Kay with a spacious work area open to the floor through a doorless passage on one side—not too private, for he likes to spend the workday in constant stir, eliciting and dispensing ideas among his co-workers with equal generosity. He greets you wearing an oval name tag reading “Alan” and bearing a picture of Mickey Mouse. It should look ludicrous and it does, until you remember that this is the man whose playful digitized image of Cookie Monster launched the age of the personal computer. Or that he is now employed—as are two other members of the extraordinary team he assembled at PARC—by the Walt Disney Company, which has entrusted him with helping to develop new ways to transmit story and idea from creator to audience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alan Kay might have been the role model for the modern computer nerd, a Chuck Yeager for the generation that got engaged by the new technology in the 1970s. If you lived within that era’s insular community of students and electronics nuts you knew his name, perhaps because you had read his lucid explications of microelectronics and software in  <i class="calibre6">Scientific American</i>, or read an article featuring him in (of all places)  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i>. You had been socially conditioned to feel ungainly and isolated by your devotion to machines and math; Alan Kay positively reveled in it, swaggered with it, declared in the pages of the counterculture bible itself that you and your awkward pals in all your nebbishy glory were the prophets of a new world in which computers and their unparalleled power would belong to the masses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Computer Bum, as he enlightened  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone’s</i> readers, was someone who looked “about as straight as you’d expect hot-rodders to look. It’s that kind of fanaticism. He’s a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship.” The hacker as rebel: Not an undernourished weirdo, merely someone</p>
<p class="calibre2">“not very interested in conventional goals.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alan had been thrown out of every university in the country,” recalled John Warnock, a mathematician who knew him first as a fellow graduate student at the University of Utah and later as a colleague at PARC. “He’s not your normal person. He’s a child prodigy who doesn’t quite fit in with your normal academics.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His wife, Bonnie MacBird, would transfer his personality to a character (distribute it among several, actually) in her original screenplay for the first computer-animated high-tech thriller, a Disney film entitled  <i class="calibre6">Tron</i> in which his boldness, his confidence, his exhilarating kines-thesia somehow survived the merciless dilution of Hollywood script doctoring. Alan Kay today is still the kind of person who communicates an impression of pure motion even when he is sitting down. As Carver Mead suggests, a conversation with him is an exhausting scaled-up affair. Once you get him talking he performs what he calls a “brain dump” on you, years of accumulated knowledge and synthesis pouring forth in a flood of narrative in which the protagonists are Alan Kay and the startling and visionary ideas he holds dear (many of them still deplorably unrealized), and their adversaries are managers, executives, bean-counters, corporate boards, schoolteachers, and all others who regard the unshackled imagination as a menace rather than a gift.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Visible within the flood of ideas is the Alan Kay who made computing cool. He declared publicly that it was all right to use three-million-dollar machines to play games and “screw around.” If that meant grad students were blasting digital rocket ships off their computer screens in a game called “Spacewar,” it was all part of the weaving of new technology into the cultural fabric. His unashamed view of the computer as very much a toy liberated many others to explore its genius for procedures other than the parsing of numbers and the sequencing of databases—to see it, in other words, as a creative tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This notion of technology as a means to an end still distinguishes Kay from most other practitioners of the art and science of technology. One factor in his powerful kinship with Bob Taylor was their shared curiosity about  <i class="calibre6">what</i> this machine could be made to do, more than  <i class="calibre6">how</i>. Notwithstanding his incessant harangues, most of the inspired engineers Taylor recruited to CSL, the Lampsons and Thackers, started out too blindly focused on the issue of what was within their power to actually build. They would ask: What is the next stop on the road? Kay turned the question inside out: Let’s figure out where we want to go, and that will show us how to get there. He never lost sight of the computer’s appropriate station in the world: to conform to the user’s desires, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s almost impossible for most people to see technology as the tool rather than the end,” he was saying one day in his cubicle at Disney Imagineering’s Glendale warehouse. He was about to embark on another excursion through what Carver Mead called Ideaspace, where hyperbole and metaphor are equivalent coins of the realm (or obverse sides of the same coin). “People get trapped in thinking that anything in the environment is to be taken as a given. It’s part of the way our nervous system works. But it’s dangerous to take it as a given because then it controls you, rather than the other way around. That’s McLuhan’s insight, one of the bigger ones in the twentieth century. Zen in the twentieth century is about taking things that have been rendered invisible by this process and trying to make them visible again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Parents ask me what they should do to help their kids with science. I say, on a walk always take a magnifying glass along. Be a miniature exploratorium….”</p>
<p class="calibre2">You would have to know something about his life to recognize this as a scene from his childhood. Kay’s father was a scientist, a physiologist engaged in designing prostheses for arms and legs. “I can certainly remember going on walks with him,” Kay recalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“And when you go on a walk with a parent who’s interested in science, it’s usually about all the things that you can’t readily see.” This sort of unleashed curiosity would allow him to recognize new ways of placing computing power in everyone’s hands. But he had to travel a fair distance before discovering that his destiny lay in the arcane science of systems programming. That might never have happened at all had circumstances not left him becalmed on an Air Force base in Waco, Texas, in the suspended state of existence known as “Figmo.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The term is a military acronym for “Fuck it, got my orders.” As always with service slang, one can hardly think of a better way to describe the condition. It was 1961 and Kay was marking off the last two years of his enlistment. At this moment he was working in the pathology lab at James Conway AFB, on the verge of being transferred on. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“I was in figmo, when you’re at your old base but everybody knows you’re about to go somewhere else. You’re not for real anymore on this old base. You sit around and play cards and read books, one of the best things in the military. I was trying to get a little better at poker with a figmo who was a professional poker player, the trick being to see if I could make it a learning experience instead of just getting fleeced.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if Kay could not be ordered to do a damn thing pending his transfer, his state of enforced idleness left him wide open to being enticed. In this case the enticement was the scheduling of an aptitude test for computer programmers. No one from Conway had ever passed this test. To a prodigy, however, any standardized test is like a carnival midway. Kay, whose mind was as nimble as it was underemployed, viewed it as a lark. “No way I’d ever pass up a test,” he said. Naturally, he passed handily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As luck would have it, the Air Force did not view programmer training quite so casually. Undergoing a full-scale conversion from primitive punch card tabulators to the IBM 1401, the world’s first popular general business computer, the service was pulling linguists out of Europe to turn them into programmers and scouring the ranks for anyone showing the slightest ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They figured that since you’d taken this test, IBM could teach you to program the 1401 from scratch in one week,” Kay recalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It wasn’t computer science, just training, but it was the best training I’ve ever had. You worked your ass off and at the end of the week you could program a computer.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the surface Kay seemed an unlikely candidate to take to the rigors of instructing a machine how to operate, for by habit he responded poorly to rules and regulations not his own. The explanation, however, lies in how a computer’s stern and unyielding logical rules can lead to infinitely creative results.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Computers look smart, but their intelligence is a fraud, a sleight-of-hand stunt abetted by blinding speed and a capacity for infinite reiteration. They must be instructed how to perform every tiny step of a problem of ratiocination, and in what sequence. That is why nothing that ever happens inside a computer is entirely unexpected (unless it is going wrong). The machine has been shown the way by its programmer, like a child taken for a stroll along a garden path. Both partners know the rules of the journey. Let the programmer stray one step off the path—let’s say by coding a command that violates the machine’s logic—and the computer will refuse to follow. Let the computer break the rules—refusing to take the next step along the mandated path—and the programmer will know it is sick and must be cured before they can take even one more stride together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Obviously, then, programmers must conform to a system. They instruct the machine to follow a series of conditions ( <i class="calibre6">if</i> such-and-such a condition is met, do this; otherwise do  <i class="calibre6">that…. If</i> you have done  <i class="calibre6">that</i>, and such-and-such a state also exists, do  <i class="calibre6">this</i>; else  <i class="calibre6">that</i>).</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the conditions must themselves conform to logic that has been burned into the machine’s circuits by the designer, or it will not comprehend. Computer programming is the process of telling a computer in its own language how to read and follow this cascade of “ifs.” The programmer establishes a set of rules that happen to conform in a very fundamental way to the machine’s own. It is the ultimate recursive endeavor, the joint discovery of rules and regulations leading to the invention of more rules and regulations that allow the machine to extend and expand its abilities and, consequently, those of its programmer and user. Alan Kay would become an expert in this partnership (and in a related field, the programming of programmers; but that lay far in the future).</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there is a marvelous catch: These logical rules and regulations can apply to any abstract conditions the programmer chooses to define. As Kay put it years later: “Computers’ use of symbols, like the use of symbols in language and mathematics, is sufficiently disconnected from the real world to enable them to create splendid nonsense…Although the hardware of the computer is subject to natural laws (electrons can move through the circuits only in certain physically defined ways), the range of simulations the computer can perform is bounded only by the limits of human imagination. In a computer, spacecraft can be made to travel faster than the speed of light, time to travel in reverse.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">His enchantment with a system so rigidly structured yet infinitely malleable may have had to do with his childhood in the bosom of a close but itinerant family. One year after his birth in 1940 in Springfield, Massachusetts, the family had moved to Australia, his father’s native land. Only four years later they were on the move again, fleeing a Japanese fleet that had already reached New Guinea and seemed prepared to continue its way south without resistance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Back in the United States the Kays took up residence in the Hadley, Massachusetts, farmhouse of Alan’s maternal grandfather. He was Clifton Johnson, a writer, musician, and pioneering documentary photographer early in the century. In this farmhouse Kay’s education began.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clifton Johnson had died the year of Alan’s birth, inspiring a family fancy that the old man’s inquisitive and creative temperament had been infused into the grandson’s. More prosaically, Johnson had filled the house with books, five thousand of them, addressing every topic under the sun. Alan reached first grade as a five-year-old autodidact. “By the time I got to school, I had already read a couple hundred books. I knew in the first grade that they were lying to me because I had already been exposed to other points of view.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They didn’t like the idea of having different points of view, so it was a battle.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were some respites from the combat. One was music, taught to him by his mother, who had received her own musical training from Johnson himself. But otherwise the contest continued through his entire school career. This ranged, thanks to his father’s career as a university scientist and a physiologist, from the elite Brooklyn Technical High School to public school in Port Washington on sub-urban Long Island. There were sickly periods leading to further self-education, including a bad bout of rheumatic fever in his senior year of high school, and further contentiousness (a dismissal for insubordination in Brooklyn).</p>
<p class="calibre2">Port Washington in Kay’s recollection was a community suffused with music. “This was a place where football players played in the band and orchestra for status. It was the thing. The Congregational Church had five choirs, each with 100 voices. I’ll never forget Easter, when they’d combine the choirs for sunrise services. Full orchestra.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Five hundred voices. The best, best stuff.” There he also met Chris Jeffers, who would introduce him to his first computer. Jeffers was a junior, a year behind Kay (although since Kay’s illness lost him a year of school, they graduated together). He was also a superb pianist with perfect pitch and a thriving jazz band. Kay joined up on guitar. The band played Dixieland jazz from Jeffers’s effortless arrangements, an interesting choice if one is looking for a form that imposes strict formal rules on players who are encouraged to break them according to another set of strict formal rules.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They split for college, Jeffers to the University of Colorado and Kay to Bethany College, a small West Virginia school with a decent program in biology. Academic disaster reunited them. As Kay tells the story, Bethany took umbrage at his charge that the administration imposed a Jewish quota to control the number of New Yorkers in its pre-medical program. The dean instructed him not to return to campus after Easter recess. Kay called Jeffers, unaware that his friend had himself been suspended for spending all his time on a student musical production instead of classwork.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Guess what, Chris,” Kay said. “I just got thrown out of school!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Great, me too! When you coming out?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jeffers had decided to stay in Denver, taking a job at the national reservations office of United Airlines, a vast computer depot located near Stapleton International Airport, until he could resume his education. The two friends took up residence in the basement of a condemned building not far from the end of the runway. Kay found work in a music store, where he could wait for lightning to jolt him into the next stage of his life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day Jeffers invited him to visit United. Kay understood computers in the abstract, the way curious kids understood them in the days when the most modest machine represented a ten-million-dollar capital investment. United’s IBM 305 RAMAC was the first one he ever touched. It was huge, specifically designed to manage colossal databases like the fifty-two weeks’ worth of reservations and seating records consigned to Denver’s safekeeping. But what really struck Kay was the primitiveness of its operational routine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The system was serviced by platoons of attendants, full-time menials doing nothing more refined than taking stacks of punch cards from one machine and loading them in the next. To his amazement, digital electronics turned out to be as mindless and labor-intensive as laying a sewer line. As Kay’s eyes followed the drones traversing the workhouse floor, the germ of an idea took hold. There was an exorbitant discrepancy between the purpose of the machine—which was to simplify human endeavor—and the effort required to realize it. Kay banked the insight. He would not begin to understand it until much later, well after the lark of taking an Air Force aptitude test metamorph-osed into a serious career choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two-week IBM course he received courtesy of Conway AFBwas effective, but rudimentary. “Programming is in two parts,” he said later. “The bricklaying part, which IBM taught, and the architecture part, which can take two or three years.” In those days every computer was different. There was nothing like today’s standardized architectures, according to which all IBM-compatible machines, for instance, respond to the same set of operating instructions even though they may be manufactured by different companies according to widely variant specifications of memory, data storage, and even microprocessor design. Standardization has helped make computers a mass-market phenomenon. It allows users to be reasonably confident that a program bought off the shelf will work properly regardless of who manufactured their computer, just as they know they will find the accelerator and brake pedal in the same location regardless of whether their car is a Ford or a Chevrolet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nothing of the kind existed in the computer world in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Machines differed in shape, size, and architecture down to the circuitry inside their cabinets and the sequences of digital ones and zeros delivering instructions to the central processing unit. The same eight-bit sequence, say “11110000,” might tell a Burroughs computer to add two numbers together and a Control Data 6600 to divide one by the other. Each machine had its unique method for everything from storing files on disk or drum to performing basic mathematical functions. The differences were entirely arbitrary, no more consistent than if the pedal by the right foot operated the accelerator on a Ford but the headlights on a Chevy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nor did the manufacturers see any advantage to marketing machines even remotely like their competitors’. Once IBM sold a system to United Airlines it could rest assured that the frightful effort of rewriting software, retraining staff, and moving tons of iron and steel cabinets around would make United think very long and hard before replacing its IBM system by one made by, say, Honeywell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore Kay, who had programmed everything from a Burroughs 5000 at the Air Force Air Training Command to a Control Data 6600 at NCAR, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, was compelled to become a student of computer architectures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Subconsciously his mind was absorbing the principles of programming that would grow a few years hence at PARC into an extraordinary advance in software design. As he recalled later, however, at the moment “I barely saw it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">So too did he assimilate only subconsciously an article in a technical magazine he came upon while debugging NCAR’s giant CDC</p>
<p class="calibre2">6600 in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1965. The magazine was <i class="calibre6">Electronics</i>. For its thirty-fifth anniversary issue it had invited a few industry leaders to plot a technology curve for the next ten years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The research director at Fairchild Semiconductor Co., a brilliant engineer named Gordon Moore, contributed a four-page piece insouci-antly entitled “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits.” The essay forecast that as circuits became more densely packed with microscopic transistors, computing power would exponentially increase in performance and diminish in cost over the years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moore contended that this trend could be predicted mathematically, so that memory costing $500,000 in 1965 would come all the way down to $3,000 by 1985—an insight so basic to the subsequent growth and expansion of the computer industry that ever since then it has been known as “Moore’s Law.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That day in 1965, however, Alan Kay skimmed Moore’s article and laid it aside, unmoved. The dream of a computer scaled down to serve a single human being would not come to him for another couple of years. As he toiled in Chippewa Falls on a room-sized, freon-cooled CDC 6600, </p>
<p class="calibre2">Gordon Moore’s astonishing prediction that electronics had embarked on a journey of unceasing miniaturization seemed to have no relevance to his life at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I was in an embryonic state. I didn’t want to work and get a real job, but go to graduate school. The only criterion was that it had to be above four thousand feet in altitude.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In 1966 Kay finally secured his bachelor’s degree from the University of Colorado, a double major in mathematics and molecular biology. The only doctoral program he could find to fit his exacting specification was the one Dave Evans had established at Utah with a $5 million grant from Bob Taylor at ARPA. To his own amazement he got accepted as the seventh graduate student in the school’s tiny department of computer science.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I discovered later that Evans never looked at my grades,” Kay said. “He didn’t believe in it. You had to send him a resume, which was all he ever looked at. He was like Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders; his theory was to let everybody into training camp and give them a really decent chance, then be incredibly savage cutting the roster. I was completely thrilled that this guy seemed to think so much of my abilities. One thing I resolved was that he’d never find out the truth.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor’s ARPA money had turned Utah into a hotbed of computer graphics. Kay discovered that the day he walked into Evans’s office to meet his new mentor. Evans, an introverted gentleman of few words, reached over to a foot-high stack of documents bound in brown paper piled on his desk. He handed one to Kay and said,</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Take this and read it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The title read, “Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communications System.” The 1963 MIT doctoral thesis of Ivan Sutherland, Taylor’s predecessor at IPTO, the paper described a program that had become the cornerstone of the young science of interactive computer graphics. Sketchpad worked on only one machine in the world, Wes Clark’s TX-2 at Lincoln Lab. But its precepts were infinitely applicable to a whole range of increasingly nimble and powerful computers then coming into existence. Sketchpad was also, by Evans’s mandate, the cardinal introduction to computing in his doctoral program. “Basically,” Kay said, “you had to understand that before you were a real person at Utah.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sutherland’s system could create graphic objects of dazzling complexity, all the more amazing given the severe limitations of the contemporary hardware. With Sketchpad the user could skew straight lines into curves (“rubber-banding”), make engineering-precise lines and angles (the system straightened out the draftsman’s rough sketches), and zoom the display resolution in and out. The program pioneered the “virtual desktop,” in which the user sketched on the visible portion of a theoretical drawing space about one-third of a mile square (the invisible portions were held in the computer’s memory and could be scrolled into view). Contemplating the power of Sketchpad was “like seeing a glimpse of heaven,” Kay said later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It had all of the kinds of things that the computer seemed to promise. You could think of it as a light that was sort of showing us the way.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That graphics could be a directly manipulable—and minutely personalized—element of the computer interface was one of dozens of new concepts that bombarded Kay in his first few weeks at Utah.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His mind on fire, he spent hours in the library stacks photocopying everything that grabbed his interest in the computing literature. He emerged with hundreds of articles, virtually a living history of computing for his parched intellect to absorb.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He soon came under other powerful influences. At one conference he heard the oracular Marvin Minsky speak. Minsky was an MITpsychologist and a computing pioneer, a disciple of the child psychologist Jean Piaget and a founder of the new science of artificial intelligence, which aimed to reproduce human psychology in the computer. His speech was a “terrific diatribe” about how traditional education destroys the learning aptitude of children, a subject that must have resounded to the precocious Kay’s very soul. Minsky did not specifically prescribe computers as the answer. But he made intriguing mention of the work a colleague had done in designing a computer language to help children learn programming. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Early the next year Kay got to meet this colleague. Seymour Papert was a burly, bushy-bearded South African, a Cambridge-trained mathematician who managed to combine a single-minded absorption with the learning skills of children with a profound absent-mindedness about everything else. Papert had devised a simple programming language known as “LOGO,” the aim of which was to teach children about computers by giving them a tool to see the machine instantaneously respond to their commands. LOGO literally turned the computer into a toy. Its most conspicuous feature was a turtle-shaped robot the size of a dinner plate. This device would crawl about on a schoolroom floor according to simple commands children could type onto a computer screen: “forward 100” directed it in a straight line 100 turtle steps, “right 90” dictated a 90-degree right turn, and so on. A pen protruding from the turtle’s belly would trace its path on the floor, allowing the more adept of its young programmers to create patterns of almost limitless intricacy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">LOGO’s genius was its ability to turn the abstract (one can command a computer to do something) into the concrete (one can direct the turtle to draw a parallelogram). To Kay it was a revelation to watch Papert’s ten-, eleven-, and twelve-year-old subjects use a simple computer to create designs one would otherwise assume could only be achieved by mainframe systems loaded with complex algorithms. Papert showed the way toward reducing the machine from demigod to tool (in Wes Clark’s phrase) by subjecting it to the unforgiving scrutiny of children. Kay never forgot the lesson. As he wrote later, “The best outputs that time-sharing can provide are crude green-tinted line drawings and square-wave musical tones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Children, however, are used to finger paints, color television and stereophonic records, and they usually find the things that can be accomplished with a low-capacity time-sharing system insufficiently stimulating to maintain their interest.” Or as Kay and his colleague Adele Goldberg wrote later: “If ‘the medium is the message,’ then the message of low-bandwidth time-sharing is ‘blah.’” When his turn came to design a programming language at PARC, he would invest it with several unmistakable elements of Papert’s system: its visual feedback, its accessibility to novices, and its orientation to the wonder and creativity of childhood. Partially in deference to this last factor, he would call it “Smalltalk.” While Kay was taking these first mind-blowing excursions into Ideaspace, the caliber of graphics research at Utah was exploding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ivan Sutherland had joined the faculty to work with his friend Dave Evans (they would eventually form a partnership to manufacture interactive military simulators). Kay’s fellow grad student John Warnock achieved a graphics milestone by solving the famous</p>
<p class="calibre2">“hidden-line problem,” which applied to how computers could draw the outline of a form when it is partially hidden behind another—the sides of a triangle hidden behind a ball, for example—so all the visible sides and angles convincingly line up. (Warnock’s solution is a <i class="calibre6">tour de force</i> of such compactness that his doctoral thesis, in which it is described, runs to only 32 pages.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay’s own 1969 thesis incorporated these ideas and others into what must be one of the oddest dissertations ever submitted for a doctorate in a scientific discipline, featuring as it did epigraphs from, among others, W. H. Auden, J. S. Bach, and Kahlil Gibran (“You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams”).</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hand-drawn illustrations included not only complex diagrams of functions and logical trees but line drawings of fanciful single-user machines. These had screen, keyboard, and mouse unified into a desktop console, a big brother to the portable all-purpose computer that had provoked such controversy when he described it at the ARPA grad students’ conference two years earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay’s thesis outlined an interactive computer called the FLEXmachine which he had designed in partnership with an unsung hardware genius named Ed Cheadle, who was an important engineer for a Salt Lake aerospace company. The FLEX incorporated many of the ideas Kay would develop in the coming years at PARC, including compactness, object-oriented programming, and the use of a display screen. But it was not quite the personal computer he envisioned, in part because it was not powerful enough to perform all the functions required by his ideal and in part because it utilized a complicated and stilted language which, as Kay recalled, “users found repellent to learn.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite its idiosyncrasies (or because of them), Kay’s thesis readily passed the muster of a five-man committee that included Sutherland and Evans. But he was tormented by a sense of things half-done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Parts of his FLEX machine could be implemented on existing hardware, but a truly suitable technology seemed to be tantalizingly just out of reach. “The big whammy for me came during a conference tour of the University of Illinois, where I saw a one-inch-square lump of glass and neon gas in which individual spots would light up on command—it was the first flat-panel display. I spent the rest of the conference calculating just when the silicon of the FLEX could be put on the back of the display.” The answer, according to Moore’s Law, seemed to be at least ten years off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If contemporary machines were inadequate, Kay’s goals had not changed. The quest was still for something simple enough for a child to use yet powerful enough to slake the human thirst for creativity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay imagined an invention called the “KiddiComp” or “Dynabook.” To make the abstraction tangible, he built himself a model box about nine inches by twelve and a half inches deep, with a flat screen and keyboard drawn on the top surface, and filled it with lead pellets as a way of divining its optimum weight (about two pounds, he judged).</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was at loose ends, depressed over having failed to make his great idea materialize in more than cardboard form. While holding a temporary appointment at the Stanford artificial intelligence lab he underwent a year of gestalt therapy (“a very California thing to do”). He was on the verge of accepting a post at Carnegie-Mellon when Bob Taylor called him with the electrifying news that Lampson, Thacker, and several of their BCC colleagues were joining Xerox PARC  <i class="calibre6">en masse</i>. Kay reconsidered his plans. Butler Lampson was one of his intellectual heroes. Through the ARPA grad student conferences he knew the others as first-class talents. If all these people were to converge at PARC under Bob Taylor, there was no telling what they could accomplish—even build his Dynabook.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One night he and Taylor stayed up nearly until dawn, batting around the possibilities implicit in a conjuncture of Xerox’s money, Kay’s ideas, and the engineering of Lampson and Thacker. A computer simple enough to be worked by children! Small enough to be carried under your arm! Powerful enough to drive a display in full color! There was only one thing, Taylor informed him at some point. Kay would not be assigned with the others to his lab, but to the competing Systems Science Lab under Bill Gunning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Much has been made of Taylor’s motives in keeping Kay out of his own lab. Some believe Taylor wished to place a “ringer” in the rival SSL—a “colonization,” Kay said, “so two of the four labs at PARC would have ex-ARPA people” to more effectively propagate his ideas throughout the organization. It is just as likely that Taylor’s BCC coup had filled CSL’s allotted head count for the moment. Since he was advising Gunning on recruitment anyway, there was nothing untoward in offering him Alan Kay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is also certain that landing in Gunning’s SSL was Kay’s lucky break. He tended to work as a loner—either by himself or as leader of a small team. Could he have maintained his intellectual autonomy in CSL, where the only group was Taylor’s and the intellectual engine was Butler Lampson? Working out of SSL allowed Kay to work as a full participant in CSL’s program without ceding his independent spirit. He could interact with CSL as a privileged equal, outside Taylor’s direct supervision and Lampson’s intellectual domination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As events unfolded, Kay and Taylor apart proved more powerful a force than they would have been together. Where Taylor could be vague and inarticulate in describing computing’s future, Kay was never less than crystal-clear. The day he came to PARC for his job interview, Rick Jones invited him into his office and asked him a stock question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What do you think your greatest achievement will be at PARC?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’ll be a personal computer,” Kay replied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s  <i class="calibre6">that</i>?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spying a flat portfolio on Jones’s desk the size of a student’s notebook, Kay seized it and flipped it open. “This will be a flat-panel display,” he said, indicating the cover, which he held upright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There’ll be a keyboard here on the bottom, and enough power to store your mail, files, music, artwork, and books. All in a package about this size and weighing a couple of pounds. That’s what I’m talking about.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He walked out, leaving Jones scratching his head and saying to himself, “Yeah,  <i class="calibre6">right</i>.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Kay’s arrival the computer research team at PARC achieved critical mass. They had the people and the leadership, a seemingly unlimited amount of money, and Xerox’s liberal commission to pursue whatever course of inquiry they wished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All they needed now to start work was a computer. Pake gave them a month or so to study the available alternatives before recommending a system to be used by the entire research center. But in making their choice they provoked the first great donnybrook of PARC’s young existence. </p>
