<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">W</b>hile his lab staff occupied themselves with implementing MAXC in the spring of 1971, Taylor got around to one of the keystone tasks Pake had set down for him: He recruited his own boss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This did not happen a moment too soon. Taylor was in critical need of a buffer between himself and the rest of the organization.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He and Pake were still on speaking terms, but there was little more to say about their relationship. “It was like a bad marriage where two people stay together because of the kids,” remarked Rick Jones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No one would dispute that “the kids” were worth the effort. CSL’s work on MAXC provided just a hint of what they might be capable of once they hit their stride. But accepting Taylor’s crew at this level involved a sort of Manichean bargain: Perhaps the intellectual tension the Computer Science Lab generated on Porter Drive helped goad the other labs into matching their energy and creativity, but they also made things harder than was necessary. Pake, who had literally put his job on the line for MAXC, observed privately that his efforts to build a bridge between PARC and SDS might actually have borne fruit if only the CSL engineers had not taken every opportunity to belittle El Segundo’s work. Pake’s pro-117 clivity for solving conflicts by splitting them down the middle and Taylor’s for establishing and holding his position in the local pecking order stood in direct opposition to each other. This situation was not destined to improve.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At least Taylor had the wisdom to see that his buffer to the outside world should in training and experience resemble Pake more than himself. The man in question was yet another charter member of the ARPANET clan. In the late 1960s Jerome I. Elkind had been in charge of computer research at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman (BBN), a firm of Boston engineering consultants known familiarly as BBN.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There he had supervised the firm’s successful bid to build a critical piece of Taylor’s cherished nationwide network. This was the system of “IMPs,” or Interface Message Processors. The IMPs formed a subnetwork of standardized computers (they were remodeled Honeywell minicomputers) that stood as a gateway between each host’s mainframe and the central network. In effect they functioned as universal translators, allowing the network to interconnect dozens of incompatible computers without turning into a cacophonous Babel. (The concept, which solved one of the fundamental technical problems bedeviling the ARPANET’s designers, was the brainchild of Wes Clark.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks mostly to its extensive work on the ARPANET, Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman became one of ARPA’s largest private contractors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This circumstance had forged an amicable relationship between Elkind and Taylor. Elkind also had bonds with several other PARCpeople, including Butler Lampson, who he had met when his BBNdivision bought one of the first SDS 940s, and Peter Deutsch, who had worked at BBN as a high school student and during summer vacations from Berkeley.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Elkind was an empirical-minded scientist with a conspicuous streak of skepticism. This temperament elicited sharply divergent reactions from his peers. Some appreciated his discretion—a trait which, after all, would not be such a drawback for the manager of a lab venturing to the edge of the unknown. Others found him an insufferable pessimist whose disposition was certain to clash sooner or later with Taylor’s enthusiastic cajolery. Even at BBN, observed Severo Ornstein, “Jerry was not universally liked as a technical supervisor. I think he didn’t have the right touch.” </p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor reassured the lab, however, that his and Elkind’s personalities would be complementary, not contentious. He saw Elkind as playing “Mr. Outside” to his own “Mr. Inside”—as a sort of human IMP providing a painless interface between CSL and PARC. Elkind could handle the bureaucratic rubbish for which Taylor had no patience, leaving him free to keep to his role of evangelist, guru, and all-around father figure. Presented so abstractly, the arrangement almost seemed rational.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taylor laid the groundwork carefully for Elkind’s recruitment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He asked Wes Clark, an Elkind admirer from his MIT days, to pass on a glowing recommendation to Pake, and called Elkind himself to sell him on his Outside/Inside plan before he met with Pake. Elkind listened, intrigued, but his understanding of the arrangement never fully matched Taylor’s. “I always thought Bob’s role was to be there as a very strong associate director,” he said later. “My role was that I was going to be managing the lab.” It was not that Elkind was intent on micromanaging his researchers. On the contrary, as a research chief he had always believed in granting his best people a large measure of independence. “The style of research that I had been used to at BBN was certainly one of very strong principal investigators ordinarily doing work on their own,” he recollected. But he also viewed it as the manager’s responsibility to impose a group philosophy—“a vector in certain areas” so they would not be “proceeding off at random.” As for the proper vector of research at PARC, “the fact that we were a part of Xerox meant that one would spend a great amount of time and effort doing things that were useful to the corporation.” If upon hearing these words Taylor felt any impulse to tell Elkind to leave the vectoring to him, he stifled it—for the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One glorious spring day George Pake made his way to Elkind’s house in a quiet suburb west of Boston to take his measure. They had never met, but everything Pake had heard about Elkind, including Wes Clark’s fulsome praise, predisposed him to like the man.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Over the course of a few gratifying hours under the crisp New En-gland sun he satisfied himself that Elkind was everything Taylor was not: a sober scientist with indisputably sober credentials, among them an MIT engineering doctorate (achieved under Licklider, no less). Elkind’s research experience was unassailable, as was his experience managing large research teams in a corporate setting. His gravity did not for a minute faze Pake, who interpreted it as seriousness of purpose. Jerry Elkind was exactly the sort of high-caliber manager he had dreamed about placing in charge of the labs ever since PARC had opened its doors. (Instead he had gotten the reluctant and distracted Bill Gunning and the academically suspect Bob Taylor.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet Elkind must have sensed something vaguely eccentric about the position he was being offered. “Why not just let Bob manage the lab?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I need someone with more scientific training than just in the computer field,” Pake replied smoothly. “The computer side is only twenty people now, but it will grow. Once the Computer Science Lab gets to thirty or forty scientists we’ll need managers who can meld it with the physical and information sciences.” Elkind, he implied, was just that sort of manager. Melding the labs? Bob Taylor’s agenda seemed to lay entirely in  <i class="calibre6">obliterating</i> the other labs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“George made it sound very exciting,” Elkind recalled. “Here was a lab that was going to be supported well and the motivation was solid. It seemed like a very, very talented group of people had already come there.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">He came west to indulge CSL in its ritual of subjecting prospective new members to serial interviews with the entire staff. Taylor had originally established this system of vetting recruits to the team, along with the rule that a candidate was required to win approval by a near-unanimous vote.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The system meant Joe Blow would have a huge advantage coming in,” he explained, “because a whole bunch of people would have committed themselves to his success.” Subjecting their future boss to the same all-day process was a bit on the bizarre side, but since they were already in place and Elkind was not, they went through with it. By all accounts Elkind acquitted himself well. “He certainly had good paper credentials from BBN,” recalled Jim Mitchell. “But I didn’t know him so I went on the basis of the interview, and he gave good interview.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake was cheered, if a bit surprised, to see that Elkind and Taylor</p>
<p class="calibre2">“seemed to interact pretty well. I would suspect that Taylor, who never had a low opinion of himself, felt that he really didn’t need this other guy. But there was no problem about that, not at first.” In any event with construction of MAXC well under way, CSL’s</p>
<p class="calibre2">“vector” needed no fine-tuning. If Elkind cared, or even noticed, that most of his new staff bypassed his office and did their brainstorming next door with Bob Taylor, he did not show it. He did, however, recruit a cadre of his own, raiding BBN for Daniel Bobrow and Warren Teitelman, two talented Lisp programmers he encouraged to continue their work on artificial intelligence. Bobrow, who would remain deeply loyal to Elkind throughout the strife to come, almost immediately detected something unsettling about CSL’s ambiance. One day he confronted Taylor about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I asked him why he recruited somebody to be his own boss,” he recalled. Taylor repeated his mantra about needing someone with better credentials to head CSL so he could be more free to exert his influence over both computer labs, SSL included. Bobrow was not completely satisfied. “I thought he felt that, just as at ARPA he was the power behind a lot of thrones, he could be the power behind a lot of thrones here, too,” he observed. The unanswered question, however, was what might happen if he ever got a hankering to sit on the throne himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If PARC’s computer engineers thought the design and construction of MAXC would place the PDP-10 controversy behind them, they were mistaken. At Xerox headquarters the contretemps earned PARCa reputation for insolence it would never entirely shake. Reinforced by a thousand further affronts over time, this would evolve into a major handicap in its relations with headquarters in Stamford. At first, however, it simply gave Xerox a pretext to pay closer attention to what the research center was up to. The agent of this unwritten policy was a man named Don Pendery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A Xerox corporate planning executive, Pendery chaired a headquarters task force—one of innumerable such bodies—devoted to monitoring technological changes that might affect the company’s business plan. In pursuit of the answers, he made frequent contact with the people at PARC, who tended to regard his concerns as shortsighted and parochial. Alan Kay, the center’s self-defined futurist-in-residence, took particular umbrage at Pendery’s approach, which treated the future largely as a Pandora’s Box of threats to the bottom line. Kay and his colleagues preferred to consider it more as a harbinger of limitless opportunity. To scan the horizon only for hints of Xerox’s future, they thought, forced the company to ask the wrong questions and ensured that whatever answers came would be misinterpreted or ignored.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pendery “really didn’t understand what we were talking about,” Kay recalled. Instead he was “interested in ‘trends’ and ‘what was the future going to be like’ and how Xerox could ‘defend against it.’”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the course of one frustrating encounter Kay blurted out the line destined to become his (and PARC’s) unofficial credo. “Look,” he said, “the best way to predict the future is to  <i class="calibre6">invent</i> it!” But PARC had come face to face with a force of nature, the corporate instinct for self-preservation. While Kay urged upon Xerox the virtues of patience and trust in scientific serendipity, Pendery pressed for a definition of its vision that could be reduced to paper and presented in a boardroom. Finally he got it. In mid-1971 George Pake sent up to headquarters a half-inch-thick folder containing seven documents, each written by an individual PARC scientist—scarcely sixty pages altogether. Someone had cheekily labeled it “PARC Papers for Pendery and Planning Purposes.” In lab shorthand they were henceforth known as the “Pendery Papers.” Not since Vannevar Bush had forecast how we might think in his essay for  <i class="calibre6">The Atlantic</i> had such a comprehensive vision of technology and the future been set down in writing. The Pendery Papers were at once a survey of the most promising technologies on the horizon and a road map for PARC’s ten-year exploratory journey. Some of the forecasts overshot their marks. Kay, for instance, anticipated (perhaps wishfully) portable flat-screen displays at nominal cost by 1980. Jim Mitchell, writing on future office systems, envisioned error-free and infinitely customizable software, transmitted from vender to buyer over network connections, running flawlessly on a full spectrum of incompatible machines (as of this writing still a hazy dream). But on the whole the package stands with Bush’s as a remarkable feat of scientific prognostication.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mitchell’s office of the future was one in which uncompleted memos, letters, and reports would exist solely on computer, to be printed out only when a final hard copy was needed. (“Much of the current</p>
<p class="calibre2">‘paper pushing’ in today’s offices will be replaced by people spending a large portion of their time using a computer via some personal terminal.”) He forecast the propagation of electronic mail and divined its unique ability to allow people to “communicate and manipulate information simultaneously, without the necessity of physical proximity.” The floppy disk would replace the file cabinet as the principal repository of documents and information.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dick Shoup, reporting on integrated circuit technology, anticipated the development of “smart” appliances such as toasters and alarm clocks equipped with simple but powerful chips. John Urbach’s paper on “archival memory” described digital photo-optical media resembling today’s CD-ROMs and compact audio discs. “There seems little reason to store sound in analog form,” he wrote, observing that acoustical information is easily reduced to bursts of digital bits—thus consigning the LP record to the dustbin more than fifteen years before it actually met such a fate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be fair, many of the startling innovations posited by the Pendery authors were ringers: They were only modest extrapolations from technologies well-known throughout the research community, if not among the broad public. Mitchell’s description of tomorrow’s text-editing and office systems drew heavily from Doug Engelbart’s 1968 demonstration. Shoup’s survey of integrated circuitry scarcely ventured much beyond devices that were already on the market or known to be under active development. Still, futurists have no obligation to venture solely into the realm of magic and crystal balls; sometimes a clear vision of what lies around the next bend will do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As things stood, the Pendery Papers were important for PARC and Xerox in three ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first was that they implicitly embraced the immense but still widely unappreciated power of Moore’s Law. The term appeared nowhere in the Pendery Papers, but its significance permeated every page. The implication of Moore’s article had been that technologies impractical in 1965 would be commonplace within a decade or two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the Pendery Papers PARC informed Xerox that the devices on the drawing board today would be marketable in ten years, so it was time to get ready. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“This was their version of the old hunter’s saying, ‘Never aim at the ass end of a duck,’” remarked George White, Jack Goldman’s assistant, who served on Pendery’s task force, “PARC was telling us that if you want to invest in research at Palo Alto you’ve got to get way ahead. Otherwise, by the time the ripening and maturing process from your research comes through events will have overtaken you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">PARC further understood that Moore’s Law would pack its greatest wattage in the visual interaction between computer and man. Virtually every paper touched on this topic and some dwelled on it at length (Kay’s was devoted entirely to display technology).</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was as though the lab had finally absorbed the lesson Bob Taylor had been pressing on it for more than a year: The computer is a communications device in which the display is  <i class="calibre6">the whole point</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The third benefit of the Pendery Papers inured to PARC alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It was a matter of setting the primary focus for the lab,” recalled Peter Deutsch. “Even though in our guts nobody believed that you would be able to put a portable computer on every desk ten years from now, that was what was said by the industry trend and the curves of various things. You’d be able to put something equivalent to MAXC on everybody’s desk in ten years.” One might argue that the Pendery Papers were another example, like Strassmann’s veto of the PDP-10, of how a hectoring from headquarters proved itself to be a blessing in disguise. They named their file of white papers after their tormentor from the home office, but they wrote it for themselves. With dazzling audacity Mitchell, Kay, Urbach, and the others had fixed on their destination. Now it was up to all of them, working together, to blaze the path that would take them there. </p>
