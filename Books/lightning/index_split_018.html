<h2 class="calibre4" id="calibre_pb_17"><a id="Chapter 11"></a><b class="calibre5">Spacewar</b></h2>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">O</b>ne day early in December 1972, Rick Jones and Gloria Warner drove to the San Francisco airport to meet George Pake’s plane from New York. Normally they would not have made the effort. The established routine whenever Pake returned from a visit to Xerox headquarters was for Warner to send a car for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time she canceled the arrangement. The moment Pake saw his two assistants waiting at the gate, he got a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“George, you better have a look at this,” Jones said. He handed over a tabloid-sized biweekly magazine he had bought that morning at a newsstand across from the Stanford campus. Pake’s glance took in the cover and its unfamiliar banner:  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is this?” Pake asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Start on page fifty,” Jones replied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake opened the magazine to a feature article entitled “Spacewar: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death among the Computer Bums.” Its language was loose and profane, its attitude toward computer science individualistic and anti-corporate, and among its leading characters 155 were the not particularly presentable scientists of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, shown lounging about in their sandals and T-shirts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The date on the cover was December the seventh. If Pake happened to notice it was Pearl Harbor Day he would have thought it grimly appropriate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As we were driving back from the airport,” Jones remembered,</p>
<p class="calibre2">“all I could hear was George sitting in the back seat, leafing through the article and going, ‘Oh, no…Oh, no…Oh,  <i class="calibre6">no! </i>’” The piece that was to cause Xerox and PARC so much distress over the following few weeks had in a sense been underwritten by Xerox money.  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i> was then five years old. Its founder, a Berkeley dropout named Jann Wenner who had started the magazine on a shoestring, had recently turned up backing from a decidedly mainstream source: Max Palevsky, who had left the Xerox board that May. Always in search of entrée to the snazzier milieus of countercultural life, Palevsky had placed some of his gains from the sale of SDS at Wenner’s disposal and taken for himself the title of <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone’s</i> chairman of the board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By this time,  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i> had matured well beyond its origins as a fresh voice in rock journalism and had turned into a purveyor of offbeat but incisive reporting on a wide range of issues, including presidential politics and economic policy. But its audience was still essentially a college age crowd, as tuned in to the music of Hendrix, Joplin, and the Grateful Dead as to the writing of Hunter S.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thompson.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rick Jones had never heard of it before that morning, when Gloria Warner knocked on his door to report that a friend had just called her from San Francisco to say PARC had been written up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What the hell is  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i>?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s some druggie magazine,” she reported.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jones swallowed hard. “We’d better get a look at it.” Together they drove to an off-campus newsstand where they found the magazine prominently displayed. Before they had read to the end of “Spacewar” they knew they had a major crisis on their hands. </p>
<p class="calibre2">With Bob Taylor’s apparent permission, but to the complete ignorance of anyone else in PARC management, the writer Stewart Brand had apparently been ranging freely through the Computer Science Lab for weeks. Brand was a technology fancier whose recent sale of the  <i class="calibre6">Whole Earth Catalog</i>, his popular offbeat guidebook, had left him with the money and time to conduct a personal grand tour of the Bay Area’s leading computer research facilities. (A few years later he would resurface as a founder of The Well, a pioneering on-line computer service.) At the outset, he said later, some old friends at Doug Engelbart’s lab put him in touch with Bill English at PARC.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was Taylor, he recalled, who actually arranged for him to walk into the lab past the lone receptionist who counted, for the moment, as PARC’s entire security force.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Spacewar” was Brand’s travel report. From its dramatic opening scene, an imaginary battle among players of the eponymous interactive spaceship-and-torpedo computer game invented at MIT in 1962, the article captured the adolescent ferment at the heart of the computer culture. Echoing the phantasmagoric tone of hacker favorite E. E. “Doc” Smith’s cosmic swashbucklers (“Beams, rods, and lances of energy flamed and flared…”), “Spacewar” painted its subjects as dashing young figures engaged in dynamic battle with a sinister state.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Conspicuous among those heroes was Alan Kay, who Brand introduced as something of a hacker eminence offering his own definition of “the standard Computer Bum”: “He’s someone about as straight as you’d expect hot-rodders to look. It’s that kind of fanaticism. A true hacker is not a group person. He’s a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship…They’re kids who tended to be brilliant but not very interested in conventional goals.” Kay’s assessment of the computer scientist’s professional mores could not have been better designed to raise hackles in the Stamford executive suite. “People are willing to pay you if you’re any good at all,” he observed, “and you have plenty of time for screwing around.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was much in what he said, and much of himself. The hackers he evoked were the kind of independent souls more easily found on the university campuses where he had spent much of his life than in traditional corporate headquarters, which did not figure in</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Spacewar” except as the enemy lair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay’s idiosyncratic techno-romanticism colored Brand’s entire piece. His heartfelt view of the computer as a tool for at once simplifying and enriching human life came through unambiguously in his breezy apotheosis of the hacker as gamester-king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In terms of PARC’s internal and external politics, however, Taylor’s depiction in the article was bound to reverberate even more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He and his happy band of ex-ARPA warriors came across as if they owned the place, or at least as though there was nothing much more to PARC than their work. They talked as if they had won the battle for the computer’s future and were already writing its history.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Brand described PARC’s scientists as aggies in a game of marbles and Taylor as the center’s “chief marble collector” (which was accurate enough, for the moment). Asked about his job title, Taylor got cagey: “It’s not very sharply defined. You could call me a research planner.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there was no need for him to be more specific. When Brand described the lab’s “general bent of research” as “soft, away from hugeness and centrality, toward the small and the personal, toward putting maximum computer power in the hands of every individual who wants it,” there was no mistaking whose philosophy was being articulated. As for the duly appointed director of CSL, Jerry Elkind merited not a single mention in “Spacewar,” an ominous token of his tenuous authority.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Spacewar” delighted PARC’s computer scientists, particularly the younger set fresh out of graduate school. And why not? They had welcomed Brand, fed his notebook with their ambitions, and sat docilely for  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone’s</i> glamorous photographer Annie Leibovitz, who was taking a sort of sabbatical from her usual fare of movie and rock stars to get the architects of the future down on film.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But their attitude came as a disagreeable shock to the company.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xerox’s enormous bureaucracy served a customer base that was the very definition of huge, centralized, and impersonal. It manufactured big machines whose output got measured by the millions of pages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stamford’s planners no more anticipated placing computing power in individual hands than they would think of installing a copier at every secretary’s desk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the computer scientists of PARC had intended to throw down a challenge to those who paid their salaries, they could scarcely have chosen a more provocative way to do so. Xerox had once been a small, scrappy, risk-taking company, but the long years of monopoly had driven that sort of passion clear out of the corridors of power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What had replaced it by 1972 was the sober mentality of professional finance and sales management. There was no room for the unexpected, especially where the corporate image was concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Headquarters employed platoons of professional image-polishers to protect the corporation against exactly this sort of ambush. The rules were explicit: No employee, from the chief executive down to the lowliest mailroom clerk, could talk to the press without a PRminder in tow. The communications department ruthlessly monitored all press coverage, issuing stern correctives to newspapers or magazines that erred on so much as an executive title.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet here was its new multimillion-dollar research center spread out for unsupervised public view in a ratty rock music magazine, with actual Xerox scientists photographed in their T-shirts and jeans, barefooted, lounging self-indulgently in beanbag chairs. In the light of the times and in the context of  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone’s</i> usual fare, corporate executives could only conclude from their insular perch in Stamford that PARC was reeling out of control, shamelessly squandering the research facility’s budget on adolescent techno-fantasy trips rather than solid, marketable scientific pursuits. This was symbolized by Pake’s (inaccurate) recollection years later that the  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i> article</p>
<p class="calibre2">“flat out stat[ed] that a lot of these guys were brilliant druggies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">[That] wasn’t the kind of publicity the corporation wanted.” In fact, the article neither stated nor even remotely implied anything about drug use at PARC. Brand was no Ken Kesey chronicling the escapades of a merry band of stoned-out party guys but a self-styled social theorist interpreting the new technologies against the era’s political backdrop. Nevertheless, for the stolid traditionalists who inhabited </p>
<p class="calibre2">Xerox headquarters “Spacewar’s” text and pictures inescapably evoked lax morals and California hippiedom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pake was anguished about “Spacewar” because more than almost anyone else at the research center, he was intensely aware of PARC’s shaky standing at headquarters. It had been scarcely a year since John Bardeen had saved the center from extinction. PARC had yet to turn out a product of indisputable value; nor had it garnered the Bell Labs-like renown that would have been proof against further attack. (The notoriety of an article in  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i> would hardly fill that void.) But at least he was insulated by distance from the worst of the shock waves. The same could not be said about Jack Goldman, who was stuck on the East Coast to weather the storm. Murmurs of reproach lurked around every corner on the executive floor: For <i class="calibre6">these</i> slobs you cadged a 20 percent pay differential? More ominously, he was getting blamed for a serious breach of security.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first Goldman tried to deflect the criticism by arguing that on balance the portrait of PARC was a positive one and that  <i class="calibre6">Rolling</i> <i class="calibre6">Stone</i>, alien as it was to the indignant mandarins of Stamford, had an undeniable appeal to the population from which PARC drew its best recruits. “It’s probably indicative of the culture that was prevalent at PARC that they looked up to  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i> as a proper vehicle for their community,” he said later. “It was their peer group who would read about what’s going on there.” But this argument, he acknowledged, unsurprisingly failed to sway “the white-shoe legal types, who looked at  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i> as something to be disdained.” There was no use arguing that more than half of “Spacewar” dealt with Bay Area labs other than PARC (where “Spacewar” the game was in fact seldom played). The piece would be forever remembered as the one that introduced PARC to the world in an entirely undig-nified light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end Goldman had no choice but to make a show of reining in PARC’s free spirits. Accompanied by a corporate lawyer, he flew out to read the riot act to his pet researchers, paying special attention to those unwise enough to have allowed themselves to be directly quoted, Taylor and Kay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I recall almost a sadness on Jack Goldman’s part,” recalled David </p>
<p class="calibre2">Thornburg. “Here we were operating in a very free environment, and somehow there was a sense that a trust had been violated. It was made crystal clear to us that this was  <i class="calibre6">not</i> all right. If it happened again, the lab  <i class="calibre6">was</i> going to be shut down.” Within weeks the consequences became concrete. The inmates-running-the-asylum democracy that had prevailed since the founding, particularly on the computer science side, was ended. All employees were issued identification badges and instructed to keep them displayed at all times. The building entrances were outfitted with security stations, where visitors were stopped and handed a nondisclosure pledge to sign. (Quirkily enough, the pledge attested that the visitor would not “import” any of his or her ideas  <i class="calibre6">into</i> PARC, a departure from customary agreements, which bar visitors from carrying proprietary information  <i class="calibre6">out</i> of the lab. In any case, the goal was to protect Xerox from a claim that PARC had misappropriated someone else’s ideas, and it was still in use as of this writing.) Xerox also clamped down hard on PARC’s contacts with the media, especially the popular press. Although publication in peer-reviewed technical journals was allowed to continue, the articles were closely vetted by corporate examiners newly aware that there might be developments at PARC worth safeguarding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A few people tried to make light of the new arrangements. Badges got blown up into T-shirt imprints, so they could be more fashionably worn. One employee turned his into a belt buckle. If the guards and receptionists noted that the ID photographs on others had been artfully pasted over with the heads of Mickey Mouse or the face of George Washington cut from a dollar bill, they never said so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the atmosphere at CSL and SSL subtly and permanently changed. In a sense the  <i class="calibre6">Rolling Stone</i> flap catalyzed a process that was bound to take place anyway. With MAXC behind them and the computer labs’ head counts approaching critical mass, it was time to recognize that their work was too innovative and important to be any longer the grist of carefree gossip. It was time for them to abandon the childishness of prodigies. They were engaged in a greater quest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, however, “Spacewar” carried the seed of the </p>
<p class="calibre2">PARC mystique farther beyond its boundaries than ever before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before its publication the center’s fame extended only to the limits of an insular circle of computer pros. Then came Alan Kay, sharing with Stewart Brand’s hip and impressionable readers his assessment of his colleagues as “really a frightening group, by far the best I know of as far as talent and creativity. The people here all are used to dealing lightning with both hands.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">These were bold words when Kay uttered them to Brand in the fall of 1972. Once PARC unveiled its newest machine a few short months later, they would sound like an understatement. </p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="CHAPTER 12"><b class="calibre4" id="toc_1">CHAPTER 12</b></a></p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Thacker’s Bet</b></p>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">T</b>he race to build the Alto began one beautiful day in September when Chuck Thacker and Butler Lampson showed up at Alan Kay’s office door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alan,” they said, “do you have any money?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Sure,” he replied. “I’ve got about $230,000 in my budget. Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How would you like us to use it to build your little machine?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’d like it fine,” Kay replied. “But what’s the hurry?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, we were going to do it anyway,” Lampson replied. “But Chuck’s just made a bet that he can design a whole machine in just three months.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For Kay, the appearance of his two colleagues from down the hall marked the end of a long, difficult summer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The year had started with a glimmer of optimism. Kay had the feeling he might finally be within striking distance of turning some of his great ideas into reality. He had reworked his Dynabook concept into something he called “miniCom,” a keyboard, screen, and processor bundled into a portable, suitcase-sized package.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the software aces he had brought together as PARC’s Learning Research </p>
<p class="calibre2">Group had turned his outline for a simplified programming language into real code, to which he gave the characteristically puckish name</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Smalltalk.” (Most programming systems “were named Zeus, Odin, and Thor and hardly did anything,” he explained. “I figured that</p>
<p class="calibre2">‘Smalltalk’ was so innocuous a label that if it ever did anything nice people would be pleasantly surprised.”)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay’s team had already demonstrated Smalltalk’s implicit power by running rudimentary but dazzling programs of computer-generated graphics and animation on a video display system built by Bill English’s design group. Kay himself was a compulsive promoter, producing a steady stream of articles and conference abstracts, often illustrated with his own hand drawings of children in bucolic settings playing with their Dynabook, to proclaim the death of the mainframe and the advent of the “personal computer.” By the spring of 1972 he was ready for the next step. Having drawn on Seymour Papert’s LOGO for some of Smalltalk’s basic ideas (although the two languages worked much differently under the surface), Kay was anxious to give it a Papert-style test run. That meant giving children, its idealized subjects, a shot at performing simple programming tasks on miniComs. He figured he would need about thirty of the small machines, to be built by the Computer Science Lab’s crack hardware engineers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only thing left to do was persuade CSL to take the job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That May at a CSL lab meeting, Kay made his pitch. As the lab staff lounged in front of him in their beanbag chairs, he laid out the argument for building the world’s first personal computer. He understood this would mean pushing the envelope on display technology—the smallest screens used at PARC were still the size of household television sets, although systems in which digital bits controlled “pixels,” or dots on the display screen, had been tested by numerous researchers in the building. They would have to spend thousands of dollars on semiconductor memory to drive the miniCom’s high-performance graphical display, but they all knew the price was destined to fall sharply. In fact, there was hardly anything in the blueprint that would not be commercially accessible to the average user within ten years. And wasn’t that why they were here— to build the most capable system they could imagine, so far ahead of the curve that they could figure out what to do with it by the time the rest of the world caught up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We know everything,” he told his audience. “We know exactly how big the pixels are, we know how many pixels we can get by with, we know how much computing power we need. The uses for a personal gadget as an editor, reader, take-home context, and intelligent terminal are fairly obvious. Now let’s build thirty of these things so we can get on with it.” He regained his seat, confident as always of having made an incontestable case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Jerry Elkind took the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At CSL Elkind held the purse strings. No large-scale hardware project like Kay’s could be undertaken without his say-so. But Jerry Elkind and Alan Kay were like creatures from different planets, one an austere by-the-numbers engineer and the other a brash philosophical freebooter. Let others have stars in their eyes—Elkind was not the type to be beguiled by Kay’s romantic glow. As a manager he responded to rationales on paper and rigorous questions asked and answered, not hazy visions of children toying with computers on grassy meadows. He was a tough customer, demanding and abrasive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He asked too many questions and, more’s the pity, they were often good ones. As Jim Mitchell once remarked, “Jerry Elkind knows enough to be dangerous.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this moment he pronounced the words that most CSL engineers had learned to dread as his kiss of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let me play devil’s advocate,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He proceeded to pick apart Kay’s proposal in pitiless detail. The technology was speculative and untested, he pointed out. To the extent that the miniCom was geared toward child’s play, it fell outside PARC’s mandate to create the office system of the future. To the extent that it fell within that mandate, it was on entirely the wrong vector.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps Kay had not noticed, but PARC had not yet finished exhausting the possibilities of time-sharing. That was the whole point of building MAXC, which was after all a time-sharing minicomputer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Kay recalled later, the sting still fresh: “He essentially said that we had used too many Green Stamps getting Xerox to fund the time-shared MAXC, and this use of resources for personal machines would confuse them.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">And what about the issue of PARC’s overall deployment of resources, Elkind asked. A major office computer program was already well under way in Kay’s own lab. Had Kay given any thought to how his project might fit in with that one?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Elkind was referring to POLOS, the so-called “PARC On-line Office System,” which was Bill English’s attempt to reproduce the Engelbart system on a large network of commercial minicomputers known as Nova 800s. He was correct in stating that POLOS ranked as PARC’s official entry in the architecture-of-information race. This was so in part because English had cannily put a stake in the ground with a round of purchase orders for the Novas, which committed Xerox to following through. The small, versatile machines were already proliferating at SSL like refrigerator-sized  <i class="calibre6">Star Wars</i> droids.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Kay considered POLOS irrelevant to his project. POLOS was explicitly a big-system prototype, an expensive luxury model as far removed from the homey, individualistic package Kay had in mind as a Lincoln Town Car is from a two-seat runabout. But under Elkind’s condescending assault Kay’s customary fluency deserted him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He sat mute while Elkind patronizingly dismissed his life’s work as a quixotic dream.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I was shocked,” he said later. “I crawled away.” Once outside the room and beyond the hearing of his audience, he succumbed to his ordeal and broke down in tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A few days later, back in the Systems Science Lab, Kay sought out Bill English. To the extent Elkind thought of English and Kay as rivals for PARC resources, he was mistaken. In truth, English had become something of a father figure for Kay, whose academic training at Utah had left him with the impression that one acquired research funds simply by calling up ARPA and asking for money.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shortly after they both arrived at PARC, English had taken it upon himself to introduce Kay to such elementary corporate concepts as research budgets. (“I’m afraid I really did ask Bill, ‘What’s a budget?’” Kay recalled of the first lesson English ever gave him.) Now English volunteered some further advice to his wounded young colleague. Among the PARC brass, Kay lacked credibility. All the way up to George Pake he was regarded tolerantly as a sort of precocious child, engaging enough in his place but profoundly in need of adult supervision. His reputation as a dreamer only made it easier for bureaucratic types like Jerry Elkind to dismiss his ideas without affording them serious scrutiny. English informed Kay, in essence, that his barefooted treks through Ideaspace would no longer do. He had to learn to develop written research plans, compile budgets, and keep notes—in short, to look and act like a serious researcher.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay took the advice to heart. Over the next few months he drafted a detailed plan for a music, drawing, and animation system to teach kids creative programming on Novas. He did not abandon his cherished miniCom, but recognized that he would have to reach the grail via a series of smaller steps and commit himself to a program of several years. The effort bore fruit. By summer’s end he had acquired a $230,000 appropriation to equip a bank of Novas with character generators that produced text and simple graphics for display on a high-quality screen. His small group of learning software specialists had been about to begin developing the programming environment for this jury-rigged system when Lampson and Thacker knocked at his door with a different idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Elkind, not for the last time, had been following a different vector from that of his principal research scientists. As it happened, many CSL engineers were convinced that time-sharing’s potential  <i class="calibre6">was</i> thoroughly exhausted. Lampson and Thacker had thought hard about how to redistribute computer power so no one would have to share processing cycles with anyone else. They agreed with Kay that this meant building dozens of individual machines, not just one. This would take money. Not that funds were scarce at PARC; but they were scattered too widely for any single group to have enough to finance the massive engineering program they envisioned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What was required was a fiscal version of “Tom Sawyering,” in which they would collect contributions from every interested researcher and rake them together in one great pile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker and Lampson regarded Kay as a prime donor. For one thing, the architecture of his cherished Dynabook, or miniCom, or </p>
<p class="calibre2">Kiddicomp—whatever he was calling the thing in its latest incarna-tion—corresponded neatly with their own visions of the ideal personal computer—for Lampson a suitcase-sized MAXC with a component cost of about $500; and for Thacker a computer with the Nova 800’s capabilities and ten times its speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The notions of all three intersected at one common goal: a fast, compact machine with a high-resolution display. “The thing had to fit in a reasonable sized box and it couldn’t cost too much,” said Lampson. “Small and simple was critical, because the whole point of it was to have one for everybody.” By combining the latest electronic components coming into the market with their own powerful intellects, they might just pull it off. Not the Dynabook in all its interactive glory, perhaps, but a giant leap in the right direction—in Kay’s words, an “interim Dynabook.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing their offer, Kay could barely contain his excitement—until he realized they might still face one important obstacle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What are you going to do about Jerry?” he asked glumly. Elkind still controlled the CSL budget. Lampson and Thacker had both been present the day he shot down the miniCom. Was there really any hope that he would see this new project any differently?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Jerry’s out of the office for a few months on a corporate task force,” Lampson replied. “Maybe we can sneak it in before he gets back.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can you get it done that quickly?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We’ll have to. Anyway, there’s another reason to move fast.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was when they told him about Thacker’s bet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Bill Vitek was a vice president at SDS,” Thacker recalled later. “I had been down in El Segundo visiting SDS for some reason I don’t remember. We didn’t make a lot of friends there when we built MAXC, and the fact it took only eighteen months led them to think that somehow we had cheated, although they couldn’t quite figure out how.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So I was arguing about that with Bill Vitek, and being a cocky and fairly arrogant guy I said, ‘You know, you can build a computer in three months if it’s small enough.’ And Vitek said, ‘Aw, bullshit!’</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I said, </p>
<p class="calibre2">‘Not bullshit at all!’ And we ended up betting a bottle of wine or a dinner, I don’t even remember which.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But I do remember that I won that bet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Chuck Thacker started designing the Alto on November 22, 1972.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He enlisted Ed McCreight to help with the engineering and completed the design before the end of February, beating Vitek’s deadline.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The original plan was to manufacture up to thirty Altos for distribution to the engineers in the Computer Science Lab and to Kay’s Learning Research Group (his seed money was allocated to finance the first ten). But from the moment of its birth the Alto created a sensation. As Taylor had long anticipated, the power of the interactive display spoke for itself. The Alto’s screen, whose dimensions and alignment replicated that of an 8½-by-11-inch sheet of paper, produced such a vivid impression that the lab’s modest construction plan was soon expanded. In the end Xerox would build not thirty Altos, but nearly two thousand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Alto was by no means the fastest or most powerful computer of its time. MAXC could blow it away on any performance measure in existence and for a considerable time remained the machine of choice at PARC for heavy-duty computation. Even without the burden of illuminating the full-screen display, the Alto ran relatively slowly, with a processor rate of less than 6 megahertz (the ordinary desktop personal computer as of this writing runs at a rate of 400</p>
<p class="calibre2">MHz or faster); the display slowed it further by a factor of three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the Alto’s great popularity derived from other characteristics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To computer scientists who had spent too much of their lives working between midnight and dawn to avoid the sluggishness of mainframes burdened by prime-time crowds, the Alto’s principal virtue was not its speed but its predictability. No one said it better than the CSL engineer Jim Morris: “The great thing about the Alto is that it doesn’t run faster at night.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then there was the marvelous sleekness of its engineering. To some extent this was an artifact of Thacker’s haste, for his tight deadline erased any impulse he might have felt to create a second system variation on MAXC. There was simply no opportunity for biggerism.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead, to save time and money Thacker and his team went entirely the other way. Alto was like a fine timepiece somehow assembled from pieces of stray hardware lying around the lab. Rather than design new memory components, they ingeniously reused boards that had already been built for MAXC. Ed McCreight revisited his own design of the MAXC disk controller and managed to strip out a few more circuits for the Alto. Even the display monitors were appropriated from POLOS, which had fallen so far behind schedule that its specially ordered video display terminals were still sitting around in boxes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In almost every respect the Alto design was so compact and uncomplicated that during the first months, while prototypes were still scarce, engineers desperate to get their hands on one were invited to come into the lab and assemble their own. Ron Rider, who had joined PARC only a few months earlier upon graduating from Washington University, “had an Alto when Altos were impossible to get,” recalled one of the lab managers. “When I asked him how he got one, he told me that he went around to the various laboratories, collected parts that people owed him, and put it together himself.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course Thacker did not really design the Alto from scratch in three short months. His wager with Bill Vitek was something of a sucker bet. Several basic elements of Alto’s design had been known to computer science for years, and others had been kicking around CSL ever since the completion of MAXC. During the summer of 1972 Thacker had even outlined for CSL the design points for a small machine in a ten-page memo entitled “A Personal Computer with Microparallel Processing.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The philosophical core of the design came from Bob Taylor, who also supplied the machine’s name (Alan Kay never entirely ceased calling it the “interim Dynabook”). As Taylor constantly informed his top engineers, time-sharing’s success in making computing more accessible to the user quantitatively was only part of the equation: Nothing had yet been accomplished in terms of improving “the <i class="calibre6">quality</i> of man-machine interaction.” Finishing the job involved three steps: placing computing power in individual hands, delivering information directly to the eyeball via a high-performance display, and linking the computers together on a high-speed network. </p>
<p class="calibre2">As late as 1971, all three steps still seemed technically unfeasible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Computing power and memory were plainly too expensive to hand out in individual parcels, especially since they were consumed insatiably by the so-called “calligraphic” display tubes then in use with graphics-oriented computers. Moreover, because these displays laboriously constructed their images stroke by stroke, rather than by scanning a phosphor beam across a luminous surface thousands of times a second like television tubes, they were prone to annoying flicker. These were not qualities that would lend themselves to relaxed communication between man and machine. As for existing network technologies, they were either complex and slow or, like the ARPANET, required the installation of hundreds of thousands of dollars in specialized hardware.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then there was Taylor’s habit of speaking in parables when he could not articulate his ideas in the precise argot of engineering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“When we were building MAXC, Taylor told Chuck and me a bunch of stuff we couldn’t understand at all at the time,” Lampson recalled in amusement. “We dismissed it as the ravings of a technically illiterate manager. But looking back on it two years later, it was crystal clear what he was trying to tell us to do:  <i class="calibre6">Build the Alto</i>.” What had changed by mid-1972 was their recognition of how quickly memory and computing power were sliding down the cost curve. “It was only when we realized that memory would get really cheap, when we understood Moore’s Law and internalized it,” recalled Thacker, “that it became clear that this is what Bob had been saying all along. All of a sudden it was perfectly sensible to build a computer that used two-thirds of its processor cycles and three-fourths of its memory to run the display. From then on it was all downhill. The engineering was easy. But getting that basic idea required understanding that eventually you’d have so much power in a machine that running the display wouldn’t require anywhere near two-thirds of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker still had to solve numerous problems in designing a serviceable personal computer that would be fast and compact without sacrificing versatility and power, and that would also have a display clear, sharp, and nimble enough to keep up with the processor without driv- ing the user blind. In the end he found the crucial answers inside PARC itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His first inspiration was the concept of “microparallel processing.” The basic idea came from a singular aspect of MAXC’s operation—what Ed McCreight had described as “hijacking” the central processing unit. Thanks to a common bottleneck in computer architectures, the processor, or brain, of a typical machine shared access to the computer’s main memory with all the machine’s peripheral devices. Because only one device could be serviced at a time, the processor was often left idle while some other component temporarily monopolized the memory. “While the disk was accessing the memory, for instance,” Thacker said, “the processor essentially stopped because it was waiting its turn.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker’s inspiration was to shift the bottleneck from the memory to the processor itself. In his design, only the CPU, which after all was the most important component of the machine, would be permitted to address the main memory at any time. The CPU would take over the computing functions of all the peripherals—disk drive, keyboard, and display—deciding on its own when they needed servicing and for how long.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker reasoned that if each of the computer’s routine tasks could somehow be ranked by urgency and funneled through the processor in appropriate order, he could keep the processor occupied almost full-time. If the ranking was correct, every task would be handled when it needed to be, no sooner and no later. Low-priority tasks could be interrupted for brief periods to make way for more urgent ones, then resumed later, when nothing more pressing was in the way. The gain in efficiency, speed, and hardware was potentially huge. Whole circuit boards that served as the ancillary brains of disk drives and other units could be dispensed with. The Alto’s CPUwould be drafted into doing the thinking for all of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker’s second crucial inspiration involved the question of how to power a high-performance display without busting the budget on memory. This was not trivial: He understood that the quality of the display would make or break his new computer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Up until then, computer designers wishing to provide an interactive display faced two equally unappetizing choices: They could give the display little memory support, which led to flickering and slow performance, or they could provide backup memory through a character generator, which meant burdening the system with another and bug-prone peripheral the size of a washing machine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker struggled at length with the riddle of how to direct a suitable volume of information to the screen without adding excess hardware. The answer came to him one day while he was watching a demonstration of one of Kay’s graphics programs in the Systems Science Lab.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The demo utilized a character generator designed by a former Engelbatt engineer named Roger Bates (with Lampson’s assistance).</p>
<p class="calibre2">This unit, which had thousands of dollars’ worth of memory inside, was a distant relative of the one Ron Rider would later build for the SLOT. It was designed to store custom fonts by allowing each character to occupy a small rectangular patch of memory until summoned to the screen. Most of the PARC engineers considered it a disappointment, largely because the designers’ ambition to reproduce book-quality pages on the POLOS screen turned out to be a tougher programming challenge than they anticipated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay’s group was an exception. Bored with the idea of painting text on the screen but fascinated with the possibility of displaying images, they had appropriated the system—“perverted it,” in Lampson’s unpejorative phrase—to use for their graphics and animation programs by loading its memory not with print characters, but graphical designs. The result was a rudimentary black-and-white</p>
<p class="calibre2">“bitmap”—a block of memory in which each bit corresponded to a dot on a display screen. Flip a given memory bit “on” and the corresponding dot lit up on the display; turn on these bits in a given pattern and you could map the same image to the screen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Lampson explained, “In the normal deal there would be a little bitmap for the character ‘A’ in the font memory and a bitmap for</p>
<p class="calibre2">‘B’ and ‘C’ and so on, and then the character memory would say display an ‘A,’ an ‘h,’ and an ‘a,’ and aha, you have ‘Aha.’ Alan said,</p>
<p class="calibre2">‘We’ll have a whole bunch of artificial characters numbered 1through 500, and the character memory will say display 1, then 2, then 3.’ The result was to take the font memory and turn it into a bitmap”—that is, well before the lab had the resources to build a full-scale bitmap.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kay’s group had only begun to investigate the potential of this new way of displaying information (although they had done enough to help persuade Thacker and Lampson of the need to equip the Alto with a high-resolution display). Among their first simple programs was one that could embed “icons,” or thumbnail-sized pictures, within blocks of text. Another was a painting system in which users wielded square “brushes” up to four pixels wide to draw or erase lines and curves on the screen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Impressed as he was by these applications, Thacker was struck more by the underlying principle by which Kay’s system used the memory blocks. He realized that just as Kay’s team had turned the character generator into a simple bitmap, he could convert idle blocks of the Alto’s main memory into a bitmap for the display screen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Forcing the memory to perform this double duty would eliminate the need for a separate character generator. This required cutting a few corners, because the display would now have to compete with all of the machine’s other functions for memory blocks. When the Alto placed a text document on its screen, for example, it would economize by omitting from the bitmap any part of the page that lacked text, such as the white spaces between lines and at all four margins. Also, whenever there were competing demands for memory from data and display, the display lost. Users had to be alerted to expect a strange phenomenon: During a work session the image of the document they were writing or editing would gradually shrink, like a window shade rolling up from the bottom. The reason was that as the increasing volume and complexity of the data claimed more memory, less remained for the bitmap. The same phenomenon accounted for what happened whenever the Alto displayed a full-screen graphical image. On those occasions it tended to run agonizingly slowly, in part because so many processor cycles were consumed in painting the screen, but also because the display consumed so much memory there was barely enough left to keep the program percolating along.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without this sort of artfulness the Alto display would not have been possible at all. Even within its limits it made severe demands on the machine; its resolution of 606 by 808 pixels meant that nearly a half-million bits needed to be refreshed thirty times per second. (Kay envisioned a one-million-pixel display for his Dynabook, but had to be satisfied with what he got.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once it was running, however, it made believers out of skeptics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not the least important of these was Jerry Elkind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Elkind had returned to PARC from his task force assignment in the late fall. Already uneasy at the necessity of reasserting his authority following a nearly six-month absence, he was even more put out to find that a full-scale skunk works had been launched behind his back to pursue a project whose value he questioned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One peek into the basement workshop of Building 34 told him it might be too late to do much about it. Clearly the Alto had taken on a life of its own. But he also thought the important issues he had raised with Lampson, Thacker, and Kay remained unaddressed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Are we going to invest a major hunk of the lab’s resources and a lot of money in developing five or six prototypes of something we’re not sure will work?” he asked. For all that Thacker and Lampson assured him the finished product would be the epitome of cool, a glance at the schematics failed to ease his concerns—especially after he noticed the huge proportion of memory that would be devoted to maintaining the display.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I don’t think I had the skills to appreciate what could be done with it without seeing it work,” he said later. “I certainly had questions about what the end result was going to cost and how many we could afford.” He instructed Lampson to give him some answers, in writing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lampson’s response was a December 19 memo entitled simply</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Why Alto.” In three and a half sharply reasoned pages he furnished the project all the technical and philosophical justification it would ever need. While acknowledging that some of the “original motivation” for the Alto came from Alan Kay, an SSL engineer, he also portrayed it as a machine of tantalizing potential for everyone in the Computer Science Lab. The Alto would be capable of performing almost any computation a PDP-10 (that is, MAXC) could do. It would be more powerful than the video terminal system Bill English was designing for </p>
<p class="calibre2">POLOS, with better graphics. It would run all the office system software being written in various labs at PARC with power to spare.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it would render the costly Novas obsolete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lampson pointed out that at $10,500 per machine the Altos would cost barely half what PARC had spent per CSL member in building MAXC. (With a full complement of memory, as it turned out, the first few Altos cost closer to $18,000. After the original design was reengineered for efficiency and a high-volume manufacturing program was put in place, however, that dropped down to about $12,000.) Lampson considered himself on firm ground in stating that the machine would be cheap enough to enable PARC to afford one for every member of the lab.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If our theories about the utility of cheap, powerful personal computers are correct,” he concluded, “we should be able to demonstrate them convincingly on Alto. If they are wrong, we can find out why.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">By early April the first prototype was ready to start computing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker and McCreight together had worked out the priority by which sixteen essential computing tasks would contend for the processor’s attention. This basically involved determining how quickly each task had to be completed before it failed, and how important it was for the rest of the machine. Transferring data between the disk and the memory was particularly critical, for instance, because without data in memory nothing else would work. Therefore disk operations earned the highest priority. Next came the display (actually three tasks—one to refresh the horizontal scan, one for the vertical, and a third to transfer display data into and out of memory).</p>
<p class="calibre2">Any untoward delay here would mean rendering the screen unintelligible. Farther down the list came monitoring the local network (the Ethernet, being invented concurrently down the hall by Bob Metcalfe and David Boggs) and running the Alto’s basic program, a variant of the Nova’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker and McCreight were so pleased with their task-switching scheme they started preparing a patent application, at which point they discovered to their great embarrassment that someone had got there first. The bearer of this jarring news was Wes Clark, who was the pioneer in question. Trim and lantern-jawed as ever, Clark served as senior  sultant to the Computer Science Lab. During one of his regular consulting visits he had learned of the patent proposal. One day thereafter he showed up in the Alto workshop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This Alto stuff is pretty interesting,” he observed, deadpan. “I wonder if, in a few words, you could say what the relationship is to the TX-2 and in particular to the task structure of the TX-2?” Neither Thacker nor McCreight knew much about Clark’s trailblazing thirteen-year-old machine. They looked at each other, perplexed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, ah, well, ah,” McCreight stammered out, “not very well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, as it happens I have some copies of the TX-2 documentation here I could leave with you,” Clark said. “Why don’t I just come back and ask the question later?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night they pored over the papers in a state of shock. Clark’s TX-2, they recognized, had used almost exactly the same task-priority scheme as the Alto.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next day Clark returned to find the two engineers profoundly ashamed at not having read the literature earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Wes,” said McCreight, “my only excuse is I was in the eighth grade at the time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first two prototype Altos took shape in the basement workshop of Building 34. They came into the world naked and blind, as helpless as hatchlings, for the hardware had been built so quickly that the software to run it was still months from completion and its essential programs had to be bootstrapped in from the nearest Nova.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Any semblance of helplessness dissolved, however, the moment the screen lit up. The sight of black letters, figures, and symbols displayed in sharp relief against its glowing white background burned itself instantly into one’s consciousness. No one doubted that the Alto marked the omega to every thread of computer science that had come before and the alpha of a dazzling new world; and no one ever forgot the pure euphoria they felt the first time they saw an Alto running.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It was like watching a baby waving its arms,” recalled John Shoch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Waving its arms as if to say, ‘I’m alive! I’m alive!’” </p>
