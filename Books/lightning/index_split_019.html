<h2 class="calibre4" id="calibre_pb_18"><a id="CHAPTER 13"><b class="calibre5">The Bobbsey Twins Build a Network</b></a></h2>
<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">D</b>avid Boggs was in his usual haunt—the basement workshop where he uncrated, assembled, and tested POLOS’s newly ordered Novas—when he first laid eyes on the red-bearded stranger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Burly and athletic, the man came down into the shop carrying a yellow reel of coaxial television cable like a fireman toting a length of hose. He sidestepped the piles of wood and particle board the Bose Conspiracy had piled up in a corner to build their fake 901s; and manhandled the thousand-foot reel up to a workbench, on which he deposited an oscilloscope and a pulse generator. Then he started fumbling around with a soldering iron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boggs watched with curiosity. “I knew what he was doing,” he said later. “He was going to be firing pulses down the cable and looking at the output through the scope.” He also recognized, the way a horseman does a greenhorn who has never been in a saddle before, that this individual was no artist with a soldering iron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boggs, in contrast, had cut his teeth wiring ham radios while growing up in Washington, D.C., then had spent his college breaks wielding all manner of electrical implement to keep the local NBC television transmitter on the air. He padded over in his moccasins, his blond ponytail swinging to and fro, to offer the stranger a helping hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the first time he and Bob Metcalfe would work together, but not the last. Over the next two years they would be so inseparable they would become known throughout PARC as the Bobbsey Twins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Few would have cast them as plausible partners. Metcalfe hailed, as though at the top of his lungs, from Brooklyn and Long Island.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had graduated from Harvard and MIT—bitching every step of the way, to hear him tell it—with degrees in electrical engineering, business, and applied mathematics. Boggs was the quintessential introvert, an ascetic radiohead with an undergraduate degree from Princeton. Metcalfe was all sharp elbows, opinionated and confrontational, not above giving the caldron a stir if he did not sniff enough conflict in the air. Boggs kept to himself—in a conversation he spoke slowly and carefully, his eyes focused on the ground or off into space, as though scrupulously weighing every word.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their aspirations appeared to be at odds, too. Metcalfe was embarked on a determined search for the main chance. (He would eventually leave PARC to start a multimillion-dollar networking company.) “The first time I ever heard the term ‘venture capital,’” one colleague remembered, “I heard it from Bob Metcalfe.” But Boggs always talked as though he would be content doing pure research all his life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In sum, they seemed to have little in common beyond the Brooks Brothers button-down shirts they both favored (though Boggs preferred yellow and Metcalfe blue). They were the most eccentric partnership PARC ever knew, and the most productive. Working together in mysterious harmony they invented a new way for computers to talk to each other, the great digital party line known as Ethernet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Brash and outspoken by nature, Metcalfe arrived in Palo Alto in June 1972 bearing a humiliating burden: Harvard had rejected his doctoral thesis. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This affront had capped a long and difficult relationship. Metcalfe had earned his dual bachelor’s degrees (electrical engineering and business) down the road at MIT. As a graduate school, he believed, Harvard could never measure up to Tech. “It’s probably an idiosyncratic thing,” he related acerbically years later. “But I hated Harvard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At MIT students got to do stuff and at Harvard they didn’t. At MITyou learn by doing because you’re an engineer. At Harvard they want you to be a scientist, and scientists would  <i class="calibre6">never</i> soil themselves by  <i class="calibre6">doing</i> things.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The difference had been driven home to him shortly after he started working part-time on the ARPANET. As an eager new grad student he offered to help Harvard get on the system by building the necessary interface between its PDP-10 and the IMP, one of the stand-alone machines that was every node’s portal to the main network. This was not rocket science; he planned simply to duplicate the unit he had already built for MIT. But Harvard turned him down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They said, ‘You’re just a grad student, and we’re going to have it done by a company named Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman,’” he recalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“And BBN assigned the job to a part-time employee on their staff named Ben Barker, who turned out to be a grad student at Harvard, just like me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if the snub helped sour him on Harvard, it had no effect on his burgeoning enchantment with the ARPANET. Metcalfe was every bit as preoccupied as Bob Taylor with the idea of placing computers in direct digital conjunction. But he engaged in it at a level closer to the machine—he was less interested in what could be accomplished by linking computers than in how to actually move the bits from node to node. Finding new ways to make that happen would become his life’s work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While completing his studies at Harvard, he continued to work part-time on the ARPANET link at MIT. By 1972, when he was ready to take his doctorate, he was so securely bound into the ARPANETbureaucracy that he was chosen as a so-called “facilitator”—a sort of technical nurse-maid who escorted IMPs to their new homes around the country to make sure they got properly hooked in and booted up. His connections made him a valuable property on the outside. “I was hot stuff because the ARPANET was hot stuff and ARPA was a major source of funding,” he recalled. He spent that spring getting wined and dined by prospective employers, eventually landing nine job offers from supplicants that included BBN, Doug Engelbart, and a number of leading universities. The best offer—no surprise—came from Jerry Elkind and Bob Taylor at PARC. Not only was it the most money ($19,000, beating everyone else by several thousand dollars), “but it was the cleanest, most straightforward deal in the world, a high-paying job in a beautiful place with no teaching responsibilities. There was no tenure bullshit and no students, and you got to work with Butler Lampson and Alan Kay and Chuck Thacker.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Metcalfe returned to Cambridge to pack with his wife and suffer through his one remaining academic obligation, the defense of his doctoral thesis before a faculty committee. He expected it to be a breeze, insofar as his thesis was a study of how networks transmitted data in discrete digital packets and he had just spent two years with his head buried in IMP circuitry. The committee, as it happened, was waiting for him with a sock filled with wet sand. He went into the committee room for his oral defense and received his answer on the spot: His thesis was “insufficiently theoretical,” the committee ruled. All his laborious discussion of physical systems? Good enough for MIT engineering, but this was Harvard science. In other words, he should add some formulas with Greek symbols, and try again later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Metcalfe was stunned by the rejection. He thought he knew what the real problem was: Not that his work was “insufficiently theoretical,” but that he had spent all those years hanging around the MITcampus instead of carrying water for some Harvard professor who happened to be on his thesis committee. Bob Metcalfe had thumbed his nose at Harvard, and it was payback time. “My thesis advisor should never have let that happen,” he said later. “But I wasn’t playing ball with him, so he didn’t play ball with me.” In any case no amount of fulmination would solve his immediate dilemma. He had accepted a job from PARC with the understanding that he would arrive properly garlanded with a Harvard Ph.D. Apprehensively he called Taylor from home to deliver the bad news. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“He didn’t even hesitate,” Metcalfe recalled. “He said, ‘Just come on out and finish your thesis here.’ That felt very, very good.” Bob Metcalfe’s personality added a tart new ingredient to the CSLstew. He was a one-man deflation brigade, ever poised to puncture the bravado of his talented peers. Let someone boast at Dealer of having implemented some cool program in just two or three hours of stringently applied brainpower and Metcalfe was likely to remark,</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Really? Then what were you doing sitting next to me in the lab for ten hours last night?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“And by the way,” he recalled some twenty-five years later. “I didn’t do it nicely. I was not a nice person.” His favorite target was Chuck Thacker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is hard to gauge what produced the bad chemistry between Metcalfe and Thacker. Some thought it a clash of like egos—except that a similarly elevated self-esteem characterized pretty much everyone else in the lab and not everyone paired off like raging mastodons. “It was just random interpersonal chemistry,” Metcalfe said later. “I have a Ph.D.; he doesn’t. He’s a world-class processor designer; I’m not. And I’m not an easy-to-get-along-with person and neither was he, so I was on his case all the time and he was on my case all the time. It’s not that he’s not a good guy. He  <i class="calibre6">is</i> a good guy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But we just didn’t get along.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some even believed the animus might reside mostly in Metcalfe’s imagination, for Thacker never made as much of it as he did. Indeed, some of their colleagues were unaware that there was any bad blood between them at all. Yet even Taylor recognized that Metcalfe/Thacker was the yang to the yin of Metcalfe/Boggs, a relationship whose iciness would resonate for years. Thacker and Metcalfe, he said later, were locked in what he called a Class One disagreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s when two people disagree and neither can explain to the other person’s satisfaction that other person’s point of view,” he said. “A Class Two disagreement is when each  <i class="calibre6">can</i> explain to the other’s satisfaction the other’s point of view. Class Two disagreements enable people to work together even when they disagree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Class One is destructive. Most disturbances and international crises and most of the pain and suffering and difficulty in the world are based on Class One disagreements.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thacker and Metcalfe could never reach a Class Two disagreement, and they’ve been enemies ever since.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Metcalfe believed he had earned Thacker’s undying enmity within days of his joining PARC by identifying a memory fault in MAXC long after Thacker had declared the machine finished. This was the incident of the so-called “Munger.” Metcalfe’s inaugural assignment was to connect MAXC to the ARPANET. This should not have been a hard job for someone of his experience. But for some reason MAXC was giving him a hell of a time. Every time he tried to launch the connection, the damn machine crashed. He checked and rechecked his work until he finally became convinced that the problem was MAXC itself. The machine, he decided, was suffering from a memory bug.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As MAXC’s principal designer, Thacker would not hear of it. Not with the fail-safe system of error correction and memory diagnostics he had implemented. Summoned down to the basement room where MAXC hummed away under the powerful draft of high-capacity air conditioning, he conducted his own tests for the newcomer from Harvard and MIT. As far as he could tell, everything ran flawlessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The machine is reliable,” he declared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So Chuck left,” Metcalfe said. “He insisted MAXC was absolutely fine and chalked up the problems to me, a guy he didn’t think much of in the first place.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore Metcalfe devised his own test. Calling it “Munger” was his way of enjoying a private joke at Thacker’s expense. The word derived from “mung,” MIT hacker slang that meant “Mash Until No Good” and signified the making of large, permanent, and (generally) malicious changes to a computer file. Metcalfe’s nondestructive Munger simply fed a random stream of bits into MAXC’s memory and read them out again. If the sequence mutated along the way by so much as a single bit, the program would clang a bell on a teletype nearby and log the discrepancy. Metcalfe fired Munger up and waited to see what would happen. He did not have to wait long. Literally within seconds the teletype went off like a fire alarm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That proved it. There  <i class="calibre6">was</i> a memory flaw in MAXC—only not where everyone (including Thacker) had been searching for it. What they had overlooked was that MAXC actually had two ports into memory, one via the central processor and the other through the disk controller. Because Thacker’s test program ran from inside the machine, it surveyed only the processor port, which worked fine. But Munger, like the ARPANET link that had stymied Metcalfe, ran as an external program from the disk—where the memory port was indeed broken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“My fucking program found the bug,” Metcalfe recalled, “and Chuck never forgave me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I believe firmly to this day that Metcalfe misread Chuck,” Taylor said later. “Thacker liked to have bugs pointed out, because he loved to fix them.” On the other hand, not many of Thacker’s colleagues displayed Metcalfe’s pure delight in rubbing it in. He even had a rubber stamp made up echoing a catchphrase from the movie  <i class="calibre6">Love</i> <i class="calibre6">Story</i>. It read, “Reliability is never having to say you’re sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I used to stamp that on all the memos I was writing,” Metcalfe said many years later, still grinning at the thought. “Chuck hated it. Poor Thacker!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After finally getting MAXC hooked up to the ARPANET, Metcalfe moved on to the challenge that was to bring him and Boggs together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This involved finding a simple and reliable way to connect PARC’s Altos to each other. The local network was the  <i class="calibre6">sine qua non</i> of interactive distributed computing, Taylor believed: He was after more than the symbiosis of one man and one machine, but rather the unique energy sure to issue from joining together a multitude of people and machines all as one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, none of the network architectures then in use suited PARC’s specifications. The ARPANET was too large-scale and required too much extra hardware to link computers together in discrete local networks at a reasonable cost. IBM and several other computer manufacturers had developed their own proprietary systems, but they were specifically tailored to their own machines and difficult to adapt to others. They also tended to break down when the local loop got too large. The POLOS group’s adaptation of a network technology provided by Data General for its Nova minicomputers underscored these shortcomings. </p>
<p class="calibre2">The network’s maximum capacity was fifteen computers. POLOS’s attempt to double the number had produced a multi-tentacled horror of cable and hardware. “We were able to network up to 29 Novas, but that was the limit,” Metcalfe recalled. “The ultimate 29-Nova daisy chain had twenty-eight 40-conductor cables, sixty 40-conductor connectors, and the nasty habit of crashing if any one of these fragile devices was disturbed.” The basement room at PARC where all these cables came together was aptly labeled the “rat’s nest.” Obviously this would not do for Taylor, who envisioned a system linking hundreds of Altos. His other specifications were similarly stringent. The network had to be cheap—no more than 5 percent of the cost of the computers it was connecting. It had to be simple, without any fussy new hardware, in order to promote long-term reliability. It had to be easily expandable—unlike POLOS, where adding a Nova meant taking down the network and splicing a new line into the rat’s nest. And it had to be fast, because it would be feeding files to Gary Starkweather’s swift laser printer and would need to keep up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Metcalfe first got to PARC he found several networking schemes already percolating on CSL’s back burner, none of them to his liking. One was a local version of the ARPANET (but 1,000 times faster) devised by Charles Simonyi, who had finally rejoined his old Berkeley Computer colleagues at PARC. Simonyi’s design was nicknamed SIGnet, which stood for “Simonyi’s Infinitely Glorious Network.” Metcalfe studied the specifications for about a week before rejecting it for having “too many moving parts for a local network.” He started to look elsewhere while a deadline loomed. Thacker’s Alto schematics, which were coming together around the end of 1972, left a blank space where the network controller was supposed to fit. If Metcalfe could not come up with something to fill the blank, the matter would be taken out of his hands—which would be not only a challenge to his intellectual authority as the network guy, but a blow to his pride.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That dismal outcome was averted when he suddenly recalled a concept he had first encountered months earlier. Back in June, while visiting Washington on ARPANET business, he had lodged on the guest room sofa-bed of his friend Steve Crocker, an ARPA program manager. Late that night he pulled down from a handy bookshelf a heavy volume of papers from an obscure technical conference, “a sure cure for jet-lag sleeplessness,” and lumbered his way through one written by a University of Hawaii professor named Norman Abramson.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Abramson’s paper described ALOHAnet, a radio network designed to allow computers to communicate with one another along the Hawaiian archipelago. ALOHAnet was loosely derived from the ARPANET, as could be seen from the nickname of its central control computer: Menehune, a mythical Hawaiian “imp.” Metcalfe was annoyed by the pun but intrigued by the scheme. ALOHAnet messages were transmitted in discrete digital packets through the atmosphere. Because air is a passive medium (in contrast to, say, an electrically charged phone line), that feature made the system fetchingly simple. Abramson further described the network’s clever means of handling the interference that occurred whenever two or more stations tried to transmit simultaneously. If they failed to hear an acknowledgment from the receiving station indicating that their messages had arrived safely, they retransmitted after waiting a random interval so the messages would not collide a second time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This, Metcalfe perceived, would be a highly useful feature in a local network where scores of computers might be trying to send messages on the same line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The main limitation of ALOHAnet appeared to be its tendency toward gridlock. The paper suggested that the channel could be loaded up to only 17 percent of its capacity before breaking down into a incoherent jabber of retransmitted and recolliding messages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That can’t be right,” Metcalfe said to himself, propped up on Crocker’s sofa-bed. It had not escaped his notice that Abramson’s figures were not based on experience—the existing ALOHAnet linked only seven computers—but on theory, and misapplied theory at that. He realized Abramson had made two impossible assumptions: That the number of users was infinite, and that each one kept mindlessly typing even after the acknowledgments stopped coming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No wonder the model filled up with messages and retransmissions until it crashed like an overloaded blimp. “Totally unacceptable,” Metcalfe thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But suppose one imposed a couple of real-life assumptions on  son’s model? Such as that the system had a finite number of terminals—thirty, forty, even a hundred—and that users stopped transmitting if the system stopped responding. In that case, Metcalfe calculated, the system should remain stable even at 90 percent of capacity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cheap, simple, and capacious: Back at PARC, he realized that ALOHAnet possessed most of the qualities the lab sought in a local network. Over the next few months Metcalfe worked to adapt it to the center’s high-volume, high-performance specifications. He junked the central control computer, Menehune, because each Alto would control its own transmission rate. He designed a scheme by which each station would listen to the line and stop transmitting the instant it heard any interference, instead of continuing to chatter. And rather than transmit via radio, he proposed joining the Altos by some sort of physical line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The key element was that the medium had to be inert. Metcalfe understood that if the line had to carry an electrical current to aid transmission, like a phone line, Murphy’s Law would take over. The line voltage would become the component most vulnerable to failure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if there was no power on the line, Murphy would be defeated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was possible and much better, he reasoned, to send messages into a passive medium, like the “‘luminiferous aether’ once thought to pervade the universe as the medium for the propagation of light.” On May 22, 1973, he drafted his first memo describing the concept for PARC’s patent attorneys. Subject: “The ETHER Network.” Soon after that, he met David Boggs for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Boggs had found his own separate way to PARC—escorted, as had been so many others, by Alan Kay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like all of Stanford’s grad students in electrical engineering, Boggs had been sentenced to snooze through a weekly one-hour seminar in the department’s largest lecture hall featuring a talk from some person prominent in industry. The point was to inoculate the ripening “double-E’s” with the excitement of engineering in the real world. For the most part, however, the sessions merged into a single soporific ten-week drone. </p>
<p class="calibre2">That is, until Kay showed up shortly before Christmas 1972. He started speaking in general terms about the interesting work taking place at the research center Xerox had opened up across the street from the campus. Then he put up a series of slides of a machine he and his colleagues had built to mimic the PDP-10. Boggs shook off his torpor and sat upright. High-performance computing was his field. He understood that any group that could build a PDP-10 from scratch was something special. When the seminar ended at five and everyone was free to leave, he bolted down front and subjected Kay to close questioning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The latter, who was always on the lookout for potential recruits with what he called “special stars in their eyes,” noticed the telltale stellar glow in Boggs’s. Knowing that Novas were starting to arrive at the rate of two or three a week for the POLOS team and that they needed someone to assemble them to make sure nothing was dead on arrival, he forwarded Boggs’s resume to Bill English, who hired him to work part-time through the end of the Stanford school year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boggs was duly anointed keeper of the test stand, which was a steel rack erected in the basement of Building 34. It held a perfectly functional Nova, the cover removed and the parts arranged to be easily accessible in case they needed to be swapped with those of a balky machine to determine which piece was causing the glitch. To the rest of the lab Boggs seemed rather a solitary figure in his basement lair. But he was available for kibitzing the day Bob Metcalfe stumbled by, hauling his bale of yellow co-ax.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Metcalfe had sketched Ethernet out in a series of memos with a fair amount of input from Thacker and Lampson—“inventing the network in real time, working out bits and pieces of the idea,” as Boggs later recalled. But until then he had made no effort to determine if the parts would work together in the real world as well as they did on paper. The most critical question concerned the cable—the passive ether itself. An electrical pulse, Metcalfe understood, becomes attenuated, or stretched, as it travels along a wire. The longer the distance, the worse the resulting dilution and the more difficult for a receiver to recapture the original data. As he and Boggs soldered the test apparatus together, he explained that this was the reason he needed to fire pulses down the cable and read what came out at the other end. </p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have to know how bad it is,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that day they did not encounter each other for a couple of months, until Metcalfe reappeared in the basement one afternoon, this time holding a small piece of hardware he had designed to connect the POLOS Novas to the ARPANET.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Can I smoke test this on your rack?” he asked Boggs. (The allusion was to a procedure that works exactly as it sounds: You shoot a voltage surge through a circuit to test whether some hidden fault will make it burst into flame.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">They spent a week or two testing the circuit together for a few hours each day. Debugging a complex electronic device being almost as powerful a bonding experience as, say, serving on a submarine in wartime, Metcalfe learned a lot about his partner: That he was a digital whiz, accomplished at wielding the oscilloscope, and, most interesting, underemployed in his POLOS work. Presently the pair showed up at Bill English’s office door, figuratively holding paintbrushes and a bucket of whitewash. “Metcalfe wants me to work on something with him for a while,” Boggs said. “Is that okay with you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having secured English’s acquiescence they walked on down the hall to Metcalfe’s office, where Metcalfe raked together a thick wad of memos comprising the Ethernet invention record he had assembled for Xerox’s patent department. “Go read this,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That,” Boggs recalled, “was pretty much the last time SSL got any work out of me. For the next twelve months at least I spent every working day with Metcalfe.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">They slept when they were exhausted and the rest of the time they worked, as unconscious of alarm clocks or the sun as casino players on a roll. “There was no chip on the Ethernet board that both of us didn’t know about,” Metcalfe recalled. “There was no line of my microcode that Boggs did not understand. We worked on the whole thing together, every minute, every piece of it.” Boggs was placed on the payroll full-time for the summer and stayed even after the school year resumed, placing his Stanford Ph.D. studies on hold. He did not finish his doctorate for another nine years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Metcalfe, by contrast, resubmitted his doctoral dissertation to Harvard, fattened up with a properly theoretical digression covering the ALOHAnet. In June 1973 his thesis, entitled “Packet Communication,” was finally accepted (“without enthusiasm,” he later groused).</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a working system Ethernet differed from other PARC inventions in one crucial detail: It was explicitly designed to be imperfect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Metcalfe labeled the network a “best efforts” system—that is, the computers were instructed not to rely on everything working perfectly. This ensured that the system would not crash in the event of a single minor glitch (or even a torrent), of the sort certain to crop up in a network of bug-prone experimental computers. “I loved it,” said Kay, one of its earliest fans. “It was one of the great finesses of all time, an object lesson in how to make something work when you don’t know how to make it work well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ethernet’s basic procedure resembled getting somebody’s attention in a crowded library by the most efficient, if crude, method: by shouting. The ether—that is, the coaxial cable connecting the Altos—was usually silent. When a machine was ready to transmit a message, it shot a wakeup bit onto the ether, alerting every other machine that something was about to happen. Then it sent a packet comprising, consecutively, an eight-bit destination address (the digital tag of the Alto for which the message was intended); its own address; the message itself; and a string of verification bits known as a “checksum.” Receiving stations would check the destination address to see if the message was intended for them. If so, they would copy the whole packet into memory; if not, back to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, the transmitting station would listen for any sign that its packet had collided with another machine’s. If it detected interference, it would instantly stop sending, count off a random delay (as would the transmitter of the conflicting message), and send again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The listen-and-retransmit process could be repeated as many as fifteen times before the machines would give up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As much an enemy of “biggerism” as Thacker, Metcalfe implemented these complicated electronics on the single circuit board the Alto design allotted to Ethernet by stripping the system down to its bare essentials. The original Ethernet board did not even have a timer of its own, relying instead on the Alto’s internal clock for the critical duty of synchronizing transmissions. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Toward the end of the design phase, however, Boggs insisted on adding one feature he deemed crucial. This was the “checksum,” a bit sequence that would enable the receiving station to verify that a message had not been subtly garbled in transmission.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Sure, David,” Metcalfe said. “If you can find room on the board to fit the checksum logic, you can add it.” This struck Boggs as a little cynical. A checksum system would require at least eight integrated circuits, or chips. Of the sixty chip positions on the boards they were using, fifty-nine were already occupied. Then he noticed that just enough space remained around the margins to wedge in a few more chips. By the time he was done there was scarcely a millimeter of unused room. Some chips literally hung off the edge of the board, like refugees clinging to a packed lifeboat. But Ethernet got its checksum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, Metcalfe and Boggs’s invention proved as facile and forgiving as they had hoped. Adding new machines, or “nodes,” to the system without interrupting service for even a split second was a cinch: One punched a tiny hole in the main co-ax and, using a simple piece of cable TV hardware called a “Jerrold tap,” plugged the needle-like end of a branch cable into it. (This stratagem was suggested by David Liddle, a POLOS engineer and a basketball-playing crony of Metcalfe’s, whose familiarity with Jerrold taps dated from his college job as a cable TV installer.) The network proved almost infinitely expandable while remaining emphatically simple, not much more than a cable terminated at both ends that anyone could tap into as easily as a water line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet the Alto’s first users were disconcertingly slow to get on the Ethernet bandwagon. Because the network connection was a costly $500 budget option on the first machines, many PARC engineers chose to dispense with it altogether. This was especially true as long as the network appeared to be useful mainly for sending files between computers—a superfluous function, since the Altos were equipped with removable disks that could easily be transferred from one machine to another. “Ethernet was up against ‘sneakernet’ from the very start,” Metcalfe recalled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All that changed overnight in 1975 with the advent of SLOT, Starkweather’s laser printer. The virtues of the combined system called “EARS”—the Ethernet, the Alto, the research character generator, and </p>
<p class="calibre2">SLOT—were too powerful to ignore. One could now write a memo, letter, article, or dissertation and with the push of a button see it printed in professional-quality type. (“Before that, you had to have an article accepted for publication to see your words rendered so beautifully,” Liddle mordantly observed much later. “Now it could be complete rubbish, and still look beautiful.”) Metcalfe himself did not realize the extent to which his offspring had become a indispensable part of PARC’s lifestyle until one day shortly after EARS was launched. After accidentally disabling the ether by removing a piece of hardware he noticed “one after another of my colleagues popping up, wondering why the network was down.” Sneakernet, obviously, was dead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Two more important events happened that same year. On March 31 Metcalfe filed for a patent on Ethernet in his own name and those of Boggs, Thacker, and Lampson, each of whom had contributed a critical element of the technology. It was awarded (and assigned to Xerox) two years later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Second, he resigned. Metcalfe had worked at PARC for three years, about as long as he had expected to. Industry headhunters were calling. “I was contemplating moving on and I was also contemplating staying,” he recalled. Before deciding he sat down with his immediate boss, Jerry Elkind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What would make you stay?” Elkind asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I said, ‘Well, Jerry, if I did stay, how long would it take me to get your job?’” Metcalfe recollected. “Elkind thought about it. He said,</p>
<p class="calibre2">‘Well, gee, you’re a member of the research staff, and then you’ll be a senior member of the research staff, and then you’ll become a consulting member of the research staff’…And basically Jerry Elkind, who was twenty years older than me, said it would take me about twenty years to get his job. I told him that wasn’t what I had in mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, the decision had already been forced upon him. His wife of seven years asked for a divorce. Simultaneously he was offered a job in Los Angeles by Citibank, which was planning to redeploy its aging electronic fund transfer system onto new computers. “So here’s this job at Citibank where I’m to get a thirty percent raise and an office with a view of Catalina Island and a chance to live in L.A., which was appealing at the time. So I bolted.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Metcalfe’s departure rattled the PARC staff like a tremor on the San Andreas fault. This was not only because he was the first top computer scientist to quit PARC since its founding five years earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More important, his resignation provided the first hint that while they had buried themselves in their research Camelot, a whole new world had sprung up outside—and that it would welcome them and their knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What they could not know was that in a very short time Metcalfe would be back. </p>
