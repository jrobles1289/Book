			<h3 class="x05-head-a">On Model Ts and Knowledge Work</h3>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">We begin our efforts to unseat the hyperactive hive mind workflow in a perhaps unexpected place: Henry Ford’s first car factories. During the early years of the twentieth century, Ford’s newly minted Ford Motor Company produced its vehicles in much the same way as its competitors. “We simply started to put a car together at a spot on the floor,” Ford once explained. “Workmen brought to it the parts as they were needed in exactly the same way that one builds a house.” These partially assembled cars were raised on wooden sawhorses to prevent unnecessary stooping as teams of workmen swarmed around them, shaping and filing the various parts and pieces into tight fits. The factories deploying this “craft method,” as it became known, were directly scaling up the same natural approach Karl Benz had used to assemble the first practical automobile in the late 1800s.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">After working his way from the Model A, which seated only two and cost extra if you wanted a roof, through Models B, C, F, K, and N, Ford finally arrived in 1908 at what would become his masterpiece of pragmatic conveyance: the Model T. With this new design, Ford set out to innovate not just the features of the vehicle but also the entire process by which it was constructed. The first major step in this innovation was the introduction of interchangeable parts. Drawing from techniques that had emerged originally from New England armories around the time of the Civil War, Ford reinvested profits from the early versions of this popular vehicle to engineer specialized tools that could produce car parts with enough precision to eliminate the lengthy process of filing and grinding otherwise needed to get these parts to fit together. As the company boasted: “You might travel around the world in a Model T and exchange crankshafts with any other Model T you met en route, and both engines would work as perfectly after the exchange as before.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">By eliminating grinding, interchangeable parts made faster assembly feasible, but Ford still had to figure out how to get the roughly one hundred precisely engineered pieces that made up a Model T to come together into a working automobile in the shortest amount of time possible. To accomplish this goal, he tried out many different ideas. In its standard form, the craft method originally had teams of fifteen working on a single car. Ford experimented with having one man dedicated to building each car, with other workers bringing him the pieces. The need for this single worker to context switch between all the different assembly steps, however, still caused delays, so Ford then introduced a system where each worker was dedicated to a specific single task—say, bolting a bumper to the car—and would walk the factory floor, from car to car, executing exactly that step on each vehicle. This was somewhat better, but it was devilishly difficult to orchestrate these rotating specialists.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">It was in 1913, around five years after the introduction of the Model T, that Ford made the next logical leap in this process tinkering: What if instead of moving workers between stationary cars, the cars moved past stationary workers? He began tentatively, with a mini assembly line designed to speed up the production of the coiled-wire magnetos that supplied the sparks for the Model T’s ignition system. It used to take a single worker around twenty minutes to manufacture a magneto from scratch at his workbench. After Ford introduced a basic, waist-high conveyor belt and broke down the construction into five steps, implemented by five workers standing shoulder to shoulder, a magneto could now come together in five minutes.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The proverbial light bulb lit up. After the magneto came a new assembly line for the vehicle’s axle, reducing construction time from two and a half hours to twenty-six minutes. Then came a moving line for the vehicle’s three-speed transmission, helping drop the engine assembly time from ten hours to four. Confidence buoyed, Ford made the final step toward his new and improved production system by building the heavy-duty, chain-driven conveyors needed to move an entire car chassis on a continuous-motion assembly line.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">In today’s world, we’ve become used to complex manufacturing processes, but it’s hard to overestimate the magnitude of this innovation when it was first deployed at a large scale by Ford. It used to take more than twelve and a half labor hours to produce a Model T. After the assembly line, this time dropped to ninety-three minutes. Ford went on to sell 16.5 million units of the iconic vehicle. At its height, his mammoth Highland Park factory would roll a new Model T through its doors once every forty seconds.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The clanking chains and sparking welders of an early twentieth-century automobile factory might seem far removed from our current moment of knowledge workers tapping out emails on sleek computer monitors. But as I hinted earlier, Ford’s innovation, and its subsequent impact on the world of industrial manufacturing, will provide an immensely useful analogy for understanding what it will take to escape the miseries of the hyperactive hive mind workflow.</p>

			<div aria-hidden="true" class="x04-space-break-orn">—</div>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">In the fall of 2019, <i class="calibre5">The</i> <i class="calibre5">Wall Street Journal</i> reported on a German entrepreneur named Lasse Rheingans, who had adopted a novel practice at his sixteen-person technology start-up: a five-hour workday. Rheingans wasn’t just reducing the time his employees spent in the office, but the total time they spent working each day. They arrive at around eight each morning and leave at around one in the afternoon. During the day, social media is banned, meetings highly restricted, and email checks constrained. When they’re done with work, they’re actually done until the next morning—no late-night sessions at the keyboard, no surreptitious smartphone messaging during their kids’ sporting events—as professional efforts are restricted to time spent in the physical office. Rheingans’s bet was that once you eliminated both distractions and endless conversations <i class="calibre5">about</i> work, five hours per day would be sufficient for people to get done the main things that mattered for the company.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Soon after this profile on Rheingans was published, <i class="calibre5">The</i> <i class="calibre5">New York Times</i> invited me to write an op-ed about his experiment, which appeared in the paper a couple of weeks later. “The <i class="calibre5">Wall Street Journal</i> described Mr. Rheingans’s approach as ‘radical,’” I wrote. “[But] I’ve come to believe that what’s really radical is the fact that many more organizations aren’t trying similar experiments.” To justify my claim, I pointed to the story of Henry Ford and the assembly line. A fundamental lesson of the story is that when it comes to manufacturing products in a capital-driven market economy, the amount of resources you have is not enough by itself to predict your profitability. During the lead-up to the Model T, for example, Ford didn’t have more capital than his competitors. If anything, at certain key points, he probably had less. (At the time when Ford’s first Model A was sold, for $750 to a Chicago dentist, he was down to only $223 in cash reserves.) And yet, by the end of 1914, Ford was producing cars at a cost that made it ten times more profitable than rival automobile companies. What mattered just as much as how much capital he had was how he <i class="calibre5">deployed</i> it.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">In the aftermath of the Ford revolution, this principle became foundational for industrial management. It’s now widely accepted that continued industrial growth requires continual experimentation and reinvention of the processes that produce the stuff we sell. As Peter Drucker argues in a classic 1999 article, this obsession with industrial improvement was enormously successful. As Drucker reminds the reader, since 1900 the productivity of the manual laborer increased by <i class="calibre5">a factor of fifty</i>! “The productivity of the manual worker has created what we now call ‘developed’ economies,” he writes. “On this achievement rest <i class="calibre5">all</i> of the economic and social gains of the 20th century.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">But when we turn our attention back to knowledge work, we find this same spirit of experimentation and reinvention lacking. This is what I meant when I wrote in the <i class="calibre5">Times</i> that the rarity of experiments like Lasse Rheingans’s five-hour workday was itself “radical.” Rheingans is thinking about his organization with a Henry Ford mindset, by which I mean he’s looking for bold new ways to deploy his capital to produce more value. Soon after my <i class="calibre5">Times</i> op-ed was published, Rheingans reached out to me and we began a conversation about life at his company. He explained that his five-hour workday experiment had been running for two years so far and that he had no intention of changing this setup anytime soon.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Accomplishing this transformation, however, proved challenging. I asked Rheingans how he persuaded his employees to not check email constantly. “The answer is not as easy as you might expect,” he told me. Suggesting they check email less was not enough for many on his team. He ended up hiring external coaches to reinforce “that checking email or social media all the time won’t help them.” The coaches also encouraged employees to embrace stress-reducing mindfulness exercises like meditation and to improve their physical health through practices like yoga. Rheingans’s goal was for everyone to slow down; to approach their work more deliberately and with less frantic action; to realize that they were “running all the time without getting anywhere.” With these changes in place, five hours suddenly proved to be more than enough to accomplish the work that used to require a much longer day.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Rheingans is one of the few business leaders willing to drastically change the fundamental building blocks of work in our age of networked brains. At the moment, most organizations remain stuck in the productivity quicksand of the hyperactive hive mind workflow, content to focus on tweaks meant to compensate for its worst excesses. It’s this mindset that leads to “solutions” like improving expectations around email response times or writing better subject lines. It leads us to embrace text autocomplete in Gmail, so we can write messages faster, or the search feature in Slack, so we can more quickly find what we’re looking for amid the scrum of back-and-forth chatter. These are the knowledge work equivalents of speeding up the craft method of car manufacturing by giving the workers faster shoes. It’s a small victory won in the wrong war.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Lasse Rheingans and I aren’t the only ones to notice the stakes on the table in this discussion. In the same 1999 article cited earlier, Peter Drucker notes that in terms of productivity thinking, knowledge work was where industrial manufacturing was in 1900—that is, right before the radical experiments that increased productivity by fifty times. We’re poised, in other words, to make similarly massive increases in the economic effectiveness of the knowledge sector, <i class="calibre5">if</i> we’re willing to get serious about questioning how we work. Drucker calls this push to make knowledge work more productive the “central challenge” of our times, writing: “It is on [knowledge work] productivity, above all, that the future prosperity—and indeed the future survival—of the developed economies will increasingly depend.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">We can capture both the necessity and the potential of this mindset shift in the following principle, which provides the foundation for all the practical ideas that populate part 2 of this book.</p>

				<h3 class="x10-sidebar-title">The Attention Capital Principle</h3>
				<p class="x10-sidebar-text-last">The productivity of the knowledge sector can be significantly increased if we identify workflows that better optimize the human brain’s ability to sustainably add value to information.</p>
				<div class="clear"></div>
			</aside>
			<p class="x04-body-text">In the industrial sector, the primary capital resources were materials and equipment. Some ways of deploying this capital returned far more value than others (think: the assembly line versus the craft method). In the knowledge sector, by contrast, the primary capital resources are the human brains you employ to add value to information—what I call <i class="calibre5">attention capital.</i> But the same dynamics hold: different strategies for deploying this capital will generate different returns. Based on the evidence I reviewed in part 1, it’s clear that the brain-addling constant network switching required by the hyperactive hive mind is far from optimal, providing, in some sense, the cognitive equivalent of the old craft method for building cars. To obtain the dramatic productivity increases that Peter Drucker prophesied for the twenty-first century will require a commitment to finding approaches to knowledge work that can generate much better returns.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The chapters that follow will explore specific ideas about what these better deployments of attention capital might include. You’ll learn about the value of switching your focus from optimizing people to optimizing processes, and about the importance of separating specialized work from administrative efforts. You’ll also hear my argument for greatly reducing the raw quantity of work that the average knowledge worker is quixotically expected to complete, and you’ll encounter many case studies along the way of individuals, like Lasse Rheingans, and organizations that are willing to experiment with better alternatives. Before moving on to these specifics, however, the remainder of this chapter will focus on a collection of <i class="calibre5">general</i> best practices for putting the attention capital principle into action.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-head-a">Case Study: Devesh Ditches the Hive Mind</h3>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">Let’s start our exploration of the attention capital principle with a concrete case study: an entrepreneur named Devesh, who applied these ideas to rethink work in his small marketing firm. Devesh’s company employs a group of largely remote employees spread out across the United States and Europe. This geographic diversity, which covers a wide range of time zones, required a dependence on asynchronous communication tools like email. Like so many other firms in similar situations, Devesh’s company soon found itself tangled up in the hyperactive hive mind workflow, with its activities unfolding as a never-ending jumble of back-and-forth email messages. As Devesh explains, this resulted in frustrating days spent tending an inbox “filled with notes and design files, one-off messages, and single emails that talked about multiple different projects.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Like many business owners feeling overwhelmed by the hive mind workflow, Devesh first attempted to fix the problem by making the communication more efficient. Among other steps, he switched the company to Gmail, which does a better job of automatically grouping messages into threads and provides a sleek smartphone app that allows employees to keep up with their conversations while away from their desks. These bids for efficiency, however, didn’t fix the underlying sense that there was something fundamentally wrong with the sheer volume of the frantic communication that drove their efforts. As Devesh explained to me, he and his employees felt “bombarded” by messages, which “dictated” how they spent their time. It became increasingly clear that this couldn’t possibly be the best way to execute cognitive work. To use our new terminology, Devesh feared he was getting a weak return from this deployment of his company’s attention capital.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Taking a page out of Henry Ford’s playbook, Devesh began experimenting with radical new approaches to organizing his firm’s work. His core insight was that when his employees relied on the hive mind, their days were structured by incoming messages, which dictated what they worked on and kept them jumping back and forth between many different projects simultaneously, limiting the quality of attention they devoted to any one objective. Devesh decided to reverse this dynamic. He wanted his employees to decide what to work on and then, once they made that decision, limit their attention to this choice until they were ready to move on to something else. To realize this new goal, Devesh abandoned the hive mind model in which all work passed through each person’s general-purpose inbox. He rebuilt his company’s workflow around an online project management tool called Trello.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">When you set up a project in Trello, you create a dedicated web page called a “board” that’s shared with relevant collaborators. You then add named columns to the board, and under each column you arrange “cards” in a “stack,” creating a solitaire-style collection of cards lined up vertically. Each card has a short description on the front, and when you click on it, you gain access to much more detailed information on the back, including file attachments, task lists, notes, and discussion.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">At my request, Devesh sent me a screenshot of a Trello board used for one of their ongoing marketing projects. It contained the following four named stacks:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted-first">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <b class="calibre8">Research &amp; Notes.</b> The cards in this stack each contain background information relevant to the marketing campaign. One of the cards, for example, has notes from a recent client call, while another contains some thoughts on ways to grow the client’s email list.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <b class="calibre8">Backlog.</b> The cards in this stack each describe a project step that needs to be completed at some point but is not actively being worked on by anyone at the moment. One of these cards, for example, details a step in which new client testimonials need to be added to the client’s website.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted-last">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <b class="calibre8">Designing</b> and <b class="calibre8">Implementing.</b> The cards in these final two stacks describe project steps that are currently being executed. The <i class="calibre5">designing</i> stack contains, naturally, design-related steps, and the <i class="calibre5">implementing</i> stack focuses on the other steps relevant to carrying out the marketing campaign. Different people work on these two elements, so it makes sense to keep them separate. Crucially, each of these cards, when clicked on, reveals not only a description of the step, but both its current status and a vibrant comments section where people can ask and answer questions and delegate responsibility for accomplishing key tasks related to the card. Some of these cards even have checklists of sub-tasks, while others have deadlines that show up in bright colors under the card’s title. Many have relevant files directly attached.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-body-text">As Devesh explained to me, his company’s efforts now revolve around Trello. If you’re assigned to a project, all of your work, including discussion, delegation, and relevant files, is coordinated on its corresponding board—not in email messages, not in Slack chats. When you decide to work on a project, you navigate to its board and work with the cards. As project steps are completed, cards can be moved from <i class="calibre5">backlog</i> to the active columns. As new ideas come up or clients send extra requests, they can be added to the <i class="calibre5">research &amp; notes</i> column. When questions arise or work needs to be delegated, these notes are appended to the discussion on the back of the relevant card, where everyone involved in the project can see them.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Before these changes, each employee’s workday was driven by their inbox. They would open it up when they started work in the morning, then answer messages until quitting time. In the new Trello-based workflow, each employee’s effort is now driven by project boards, which they rotate through during the day. Though email is still used for non-urgent administrative issues and private one-on-one conversations, its importance is greatly diminished. Inboxes are something you might now check once or twice daily, similar to a physical mailbox.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This new workflow encourages single-tasking. When one of Devesh’s employees decides to work on a given project, the only information or discussion they see on its board relates to the project. This allows them to remain focused on one thing until <i class="calibre5">they’re</i> ready to move on. When using a general-purpose inbox, by contrast, they were constantly switching back and forth between many different projects, sometimes even within the same message—a cognitive state that’s both unproductive and misery-inducing.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Another advantage of this workflow is that it clearly structures all the relevant information about a given project. When Devesh’s firm used to rely on the hyperactive hive mind, this information was spread out haphazardly in email messages buried in many different employees’ inboxes. To have it instead neatly arranged in named columns, with the relevant files and discussion attached to clearly marked cards, is a much more efficient way to keep track of this work and effectively plan what needs to be done next.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">When I saw Devesh’s Trello boards, my reaction was likely similar to that of rival automakers who first encountered a fully functioning assembly line at Henry Ford’s Highland Park factory: a gut realization that this was simply a better way to organize work. Devesh agrees. His employees seem much happier now that they’re freed from email as the main driver of their efforts, and there have been no major complaints or drops in productivity. More telling, Devesh has no interest in changing back to the old way of working. To emphasize how much things have changed in his professional life, he sent me a screenshot of his business email inbox. In the entire preceding month, he had participated in only eight email threads, sending and receiving a grand total of forty-four messages. This averages out to slightly more than two messages per workday. “It’s a godsend,” he summarized.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This type of radical workflow makeover is easy to describe but often tricky to successfully implement. There are many obstacles, from figuring out where to focus your experimental energies, to shifting how you think about issues like inconvenience or extra overhead, to getting everyone on your team on the same page. The rest of the chapter will explore some best practices for overcoming these obstacles when you attempt to apply the attention capital principle in your own organization or professional life.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-head-a">Build Structures Around Autonomy</h3>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">In chapter 3, we tackled a key question: <i class="calibre5">If the hyperactive hive mind is so ineffective</i>,<i class="calibre5"> why is it so popular?</i> Ironically, a major part of the answer I provided concerned the very same person who identified knowledge worker productivity as the central challenge of the twenty-first century: Peter Drucker. As detailed earlier, during the 1950s and 1960s, Drucker helped the business world understand the emergence of knowledge work as a major economic sector. One of his central messages was the importance of autonomy. “The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail,” he wrote in 1967. “He must direct himself.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">What Drucker realized was that knowledge work was too skilled and creative to be broken down into a series of repetitive tasks that could be prescribed to workers by managers, as was the case with manual labor. There was simply no easy way to take something as abstract as coming up with a new business strategy, or innovating a new scientific industrial process, and reduce it down to a clear series of optimized steps to be followed unthinkingly.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This emphasis on autonomy proved influential, and it goes a long way toward explaining the stubborn persistence of the hive mind. As I argued, when you delegate productivity decisions to the individual, it’s not surprising that you end up stuck with a simple, flexible, lowest common denominator–style workflow like the hyperactive hive mind.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">It’s here that we arrive at an impasse. On the one hand, autonomy is unavoidable in knowledge work due to the complexity of these efforts. On the other hand, autonomy entrenches hive mind–style workflows. To succeed with applying the attention capital principle, we must somehow escape this trap. To do so, we’ll have to pick up where Drucker left off and clarify exactly where autonomy really matters.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="x04-space-break-orn">—</div>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">Knowledge work is better understood as the combination of two components: <i class="calibre5">work execution</i> and <i class="calibre5">workflow.</i> The first component, work execution, describes the act of actually executing the underlying value-producing activities of knowledge work—the programmer coding, the publicist writing the press release. It’s how you generate value from attention capital.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The second component, workflow, is one we defined in the introduction of this book. It describes how these fundamental activities are identified, assigned, coordinated, and reviewed. The hyperactive hive mind is a workflow, as is Devesh’s project board system. If work execution is what generates value, then workflows are what structure these efforts.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Once we understand that these components describe two different things, we find a way to escape the autonomy trap. When Drucker emphasized autonomy, he was thinking about work execution, as these activities are often too complicated to be decomposed into rote procedures. Workflows, on the other hand, should not be left to individuals to figure out on their own, as the most effective systems are unlikely to arise naturally. They need instead to be explicitly identified as part of an organization’s operating procedures.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">If I manage a development team, I shouldn’t tell my computer programmers how to write specific routines. I should, however, think a lot about how many routines they’re asked to write, how these tasks are tracked, how we manage the code base, and even who else in the organization is allowed to bother them, and so on. (For more on radically original workflows for software developers, see the case study on <i class="calibre5">extreme programming</i> in chapter 7.)</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">We see this division in action in Devesh’s marketing firm. By moving project management to Trello boards, Devesh didn’t constrain how his team actually executed the core activities of designing and deploying marketing campaigns. What he did change, however, was the workflows that supported these activities—including how information about these projects was tracked, and how relevant information and questions were communicated. He innovated workflows but left the details of work execution up to his skilled employees. You’ll see this same division in most of the case studies and examples you’ll encounter in the chapters ahead.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">To be fair, we cannot blame Drucker for not making this distinction in his original research on knowledge work. In the 1950s and 1960s, when he first began tackling this topic, the notion of <i class="calibre5">any</i> employee autonomy was so radical that there wasn’t much room left for nuance. It was hard enough to simply convince people that the authoritarian approach that had produced such miraculous growth in the industrial sector might not apply to this new type of brain-centric activity.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Drucker succeeded in his efforts to preach the gospel of autonomy to a skeptical audience, and those of us who participate in the knowledge sector today are beneficiaries of these clear-sighted arguments. We cannot, however, stop here. To deliver the great promise of the attention capital principle, we must stand on Drucker’s shoulders and push these theories toward their next evolution in complexity. Differentiating workflows and work execution is crucial if we’re going to continue to improve knowledge sector productivity. To get the full value of attention capital, we must start taking seriously the way we structure work. This doesn’t stifle the autonomy of knowledge workers, but instead sets them up to make even more out of their skill and creativity.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-head-a">Minimize Context Switches and Overload</h3>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">Henry Ford began experimenting with better ways to make cars in the early 1900s. A century later, Devesh began experimenting with better ways to serve marketing clients. In these efforts, we must admit, Ford had an advantage. When it comes to manufacturing cars, it’s immediately obvious what makes one process superior to another: speed. This design principle—faster is better than slower—drove Ford’s efforts and allowed him to directly connect improvements in low-level manufacturing processes to the bottom line. In knowledge work, this equation becomes murkier. When trying to engineer your workflows to generate a better return from your attention capital, what are you looking for? What is the cognitive work equivalent of production speed?</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">In answering this question, we can build on the insights of part 1 of this book, which documented the problems with the hyperactive hive mind workflow. In these previous chapters, I argued that there’s a large cognitive cost to switching your attention from one target to another. Any workflow that requires you to constantly tend conversations unfolding in an inbox or chat channel is going to diminish the quality of your brain’s output. I also argued that communication overload—the feeling that you can never keep up with all the different incoming requests for your time and attention—conflicts with our ancient social wiring, leading to unhappiness in the short term and burnout in the long term.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Drawing on these observations, I suggest the following design principle for developing approaches to work that provide better returns from your personal or organizational attention capital: seek workflows that (1) minimize mid-task context switches and (2) minimize the sense of communication overload. These two properties are the knowledge work equivalent of Henry Ford’s obsession with speed.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">To unpack this claim, let’s start with the first property. A mid-task context switch is when you have to stop an otherwise self-contained task and switch your attention to something unrelated before returning to the original object of your attention. The classic example of such switches is the need to continually return to an email inbox or instant messenger channel to keep up with drawn-out conversations about unrelated issues. Such switches, however, can also be analog. In open office settings, for example, you might be frequently interrupted by people stopping by your seat with questions, and if your workflow demands constant meetings, then this, too, will fracture your schedule into slivers too small to support start-to-finish work on tasks.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Regardless of the source of these interruptions, when it comes to producing value with your brain, the more you’re able to complete one thing at a time, sticking with a task until done before moving on to the next, the more efficiently and effectively you’ll work. As elaborated in part 1, this holds for many different types of knowledge work, be it deep thinking, managing, or even support roles. The optimal way to deploy our human brains is sequentially.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The second property cited above attempts to reduce the cognitive toll of feeling like everyone needs you at all times. All things being equal, workflows that minimize this never-ending stream of urgent communication are superior to those that instead amplify it. When you’re at home at night, or relaxing over the weekend, or on vacation, you shouldn’t feel like each moment away from work is a moment in which you’re accumulating deeper communication debt. In the age of the hyperactive hive mind, we’ve become used to this despondent state as a necessary consequence of our high-tech world, but this is nonsense. Better workflows can tame this sense of overload and, by doing so, make you not only happier but also more effective and less likely to burn out over time.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">When we return to Devesh’s story, we see these design principles in action. His new project board–based workflow eliminates mid-task context switches. Communication about a project now happens only when you decide to load that project’s board and review the relevant cards. There’s no general-purpose inbox where you encounter messages about one project while trying to work on another. Devesh called this “flipping the script”: <i class="calibre5">you</i> decide when to communicate about a project; you don’t let <i class="calibre5">the project</i> decide for you.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Devesh’s new workflow also minimizes communication overload. When interactions are moved onto task-specific cards associated with a project, the sense of requests <i class="calibre5">piling up</i> is diminished. When you decide to visit a particular project board, you contribute to the conversation. When you’re not there, there’s no inbox specific to you that’s growing with impatient requests and notices.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Minimizing context switches and overload is not the whole story when it comes to engineering better workflows. This should guide your experiments in the short term, but in the long term, you must still monitor the key bottom line metric: the quantity and quality of valuable output you’re producing. For a knowledge work organization, this means tracking the impact of new workflows on revenue, while for an individual knowledge worker, this might describe the rate at which you’re hitting milestones or completing projects.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Seeing these numbers improve over time will provide the confidence needed to stick with new ways of working. Equally important, if your changes lead to these measures degrading, you have clear evidence you went too far, accidentally impeding activities crucial to your success. The key is to find ways to minimize context shifts and overload <i class="calibre5">while still getting done what needs to get done.</i></p>
			<h3 class="x05-head-a">Don’t Fear Inconvenience</h3>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">When I told Devesh’s story to other knowledge workers, they predictably raised concerns. When they imagined shifting their own organizations away from the hyperactive hive mind and toward something more structured, like Devesh’s project board–based workflow, they easily conjured potential issues. Losing the ability to grab people’s attention for anything at any time might lead to deadlines getting missed, or urgent tasks not getting completed, or long delays before you get the answers you need to make progress on key project steps. Leaving behind the simplicity of the hyperactive hive mind, in other words, might create a steady stream of inconveniences for everyone involved.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This objection is important because it’s relevant to most attempts to apply the attention capital principle. As argued, one of the key explanations for the hyperactive hive mind’s persistence in the knowledge sector is that it’s really convenient <i class="calibre5">in the moment</i> for the individuals who use it. There are no systems to learn or rules to remember; you simply grab people electronically as you need them. Almost any alternative to this workflow is going to be less convenient, in the sense that it will require more effort to follow, and lead to short-term problems, like missed tasks or occasional long response delays. This reality helps explain why so many work reform movements, born out of inbox exhaustion, end up reduced down to only small tweaks—like promoting better “etiquette” surrounding messaging—as these toothless suggestions prevent anyone from having to confront the hardships that follow real changes to the hyperactive hive mind status quo.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Imagine you want to make a major change to your own or your organization’s workflow. How can you avoid the inconveniences associated with this experimentation? <i class="calibre5">You can’t.</i> You must instead adjust your mindset so that you no longer fear these annoyances. To support this advice, let’s turn back to the industrial sector, where an embrace of inconvenience is commonly accepted. Consider, for a moment, what it must have been like at Henry Ford’s Highland Park factory during the radical experimentation that occurred between 1908 and 1914. At the beginning of this period, the way Ford was building cars made perfect sense. Deploying the same craft method that had dominated for decades, he had workers stand around stationary vehicles, bolting and filing parts, carrying supplies back and forth to the machine shop, and generally building the vehicles the way people had always naturally built complicated things: in place, one piece at a time.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Ford’s early assembly line, by contrast, must have been a nightmare for his employees. Nothing about it was natural. For one thing, it required more complicated machinery that was prone to breaking down. Carrying a bumper from a pile to a stationary car was a simple and reliable process. Trying to pull an entire car chassis on a variable-speed winch system toward a worker who would then bolt on a bumper as it passed was a much more complicated way to accomplish this same step.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Then there were the custom tools. Part of what makes continuous production possible is specialized rigs that can execute precision tasks quickly. Ford, for example, invented a drilling machine that could simultaneously bore forty-five holes into an engine block. The thing about custom tools, however, is that it’s hard to get them running consistently. It’s a fair guess that during these early years there was a lot of frustrated downtime at Highland Park spent tweaking and repairing these cumbersome rigs.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Another annoying reality of an assembly line is that a snag at any stage of a process—an installation step taking too long or a part not making it to where it’s needed in time—can halt production altogether. Such shutdowns must have been common as the kinks were being worked out for the early lines. Imagine the frustration of shifting from the steady reliability of the craft method to a process that forced you to stop working completely again and again. To make matters even worse, the assembly line also required the addition of more managers and engineers to supervise. It was not only more annoying but also much more expensive to operate!</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">To summarize, Henry Ford took a reliable and intuitive process for building cars and replaced it with something that was more expensive to run, required a lot more management and overhead, was not at all natural, and frequently broke down, sometimes leading to major production delays. Nothing about this would have been easy or obvious. If you were a Ford manager, laborer, or investor during this period, you probably would have much preferred a safer and less disruptive focus on making the tried-and-true method slightly more efficient—the industrial equivalent of promoting better email etiquette.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">We recognize now, of course, that these misgivings were misguided, as the assembly line ended up making Ford Motor Company one of the largest and most profitable corporations in the world. In the context of industrial production, we readily accept these stories, because when we think about a factory, it makes sense that the goal is not convenience, or simplicity, or preventing bad things from occasionally happening—it’s instead manufacturing products as cost-effectively as possible.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Indeed, if you read twentieth-century management literature, the idea of achieving more effectiveness through your ability to tolerate added complexity is celebrated. In his 1959 book, <i class="calibre5">Landmarks of Tomorrow</i>, Peter Drucker lauds the “steady slugging away on improvement, adaptation, and application,” led by applied researchers and engineers, that enabled companies to manufacture new and improved products faster than ever before. Similarly, in James McCay’s classic business advice tome <i class="calibre5">The Management of Time</i>, also written in 1959, McCay connects leadership in the modern world to the ability to constantly experiment with how work is accomplished, while stoically handling the resulting complexity:</p>
			<blockquote class="calibre6">
				<p class="x06-extract-1p">The man of the hour is the one who can handle the complex problems created by the increasing speed of invention. . . . He is the man of exceptional originality. He is the man who has disciplined himself to keep acquiring new knowledge and skills. He has created new production concepts, marketing concepts, approaches to financing.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="x04-body-text">In modern knowledge work, we’ve largely lost interest in moving boldly ahead, embracing the resulting hardships as the cost of doing business better than before. We still talk about “innovation,” but this term now applies almost exclusively to the products and services we offer, not the means by which we produce them. When it comes to the latter topic, business thinkers tend to focus on secondary factors, like better leadership or clearer objectives to help stimulate productivity. Little attention is dedicated to the actual mechanics of how work is assigned, executed, and reviewed.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This focus on secondary factors is not due to timidity on the part of knowledge work leaders. It’s instead largely a result of the autonomy trap discussed earlier. A natural consequence of leaving the details of <i class="calibre5">how</i> knowledge workers work up to the individual is an entrenchment in workflows that prioritize convenience in the moment above all else. Once we free ourselves from this trap, however, and start systematically rethinking how we work, we’ll inevitably create short-term inconvenience on our way to long-term improvement. As my industrial history hopefully underscores, this inconvenience shouldn’t be feared. In business, good is not the same as easy, and fulfilling is not the same as convenient. Deep down, knowledge workers want to feel as if they’re producing important output that takes full advantage of their hard-won skills, even if this means they can’t always get a quick response to their messages.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-head-a">An Aside: Weren’t Assembly Lines Awful for Workers?</h3>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">When I was in the early stages of my thinking about this book, I attended a family wedding. During the rehearsal dinner, I began chatting with a relative. He wanted to know what I was working on, so I told him about this book and tested out my ideas about the assembly line’s relevance to rethinking knowledge work. I still remember his reaction word for word: “That sounds awful.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The issue in using the assembly line as a positive example is that the experience of actually working on one of these lines was anything but positive. As the historian Joshua Freeman argues in his 2019 book, <i class="calibre5">Behemoth</i>, when we think about the productivity gains of the assembly line, we focus too much on efficient material handling. Many of these gains came instead from the “sheer intensification of work.” If you slacked off your attention for even a moment, you could stall the entire line—forcing workers into an unnatural combination of boredom and constant attentiveness. Frederick Winslow Taylor had earlier tried to boost efficiency by measuring workers’ performance with a stopwatch and offering incentives to those who were fast. Henry Ford bypassed Taylor’s approach by simply making it impossible to be anything but fast. “For assembly-line workers, work was relentless and repetitious,” writes Freeman. “Assembly-line work proved physiologically and psychologically draining in ways other types of labor were not. More than ever before, workers were extensions of machinery, at the mercy of its demands and pace.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">In 1936, Charlie Chaplin satirized this grim reality with his landmark film <i class="calibre5">Modern Times</i>, which features his Little Tramp character trying to keep up with an assembly line that runs faster and faster. Wielding two large wrenches, Chaplin turns bolts on each item that passes. As the foreman increases the line’s speed, Chaplin’s actions become more frantic, leading him to eventually leap onto the conveyor belt in a vain last attempt to keep up with the items whizzing past. He’s whisked away through a chute and ends up ground among the plant’s oversized gears. Chaplin made the film soon after visiting one of Henry Ford’s factories.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This general understanding that assembly line work is dehumanizing was what prompted my relative’s negative reaction. He was imagining a future of knowledge work in which we end up in a digital-era reboot of <i class="calibre5">Modern Times</i>, with the frantic wrenching now replaced with frantic typing, and the sequence still ending with us mashed by the proverbial machinery of productivity. This is a natural concern to raise about the attention capital principle, but when we consider specific case studies of this principle in action, the feared drudgery doesn’t materialize. Consider Devesh’s marketing company. Nothing about the idea of switching work from a jumbled inbox to structured project boards indicates a shift toward more monotonous or soulless work. If anything, this change initiated the opposite effect. In a reversal of what happened when Ford introduced the assembly line, Devesh’s employees found their professional lives less grueling and more sustainable <i class="calibre5">after</i> Devesh innovated their workflow.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">As you’ll encounter in the case studies that follow throughout part 2, the benefits of Devesh’s workflow transformation are the rule, not the exception. This makes sense once we take a closer look at my use of the assembly line analogy. My goal in pointing to Henry Ford is not to highlight the effectiveness of the <i class="calibre5">specific manner</i> in which his workers built automobiles, as there are few useful connections between, say, assembling a magneto and designing a marketing strategy. It’s instead to point out the power of experimenting with different ways of deploying capital—a process that differs greatly between the industrial and knowledge sectors. As Peter Drucker established, in knowledge work you must maintain skilled workers’ autonomy in how they actually apply their craft. The attention capital principle asks you to experiment instead with the workflows that structure how this work is assigned and reviewed. The goal of these changes is to make it both easier and more sustainable for the knowledge worker to actually accomplish important things, not to coerce them into doing more things, faster—a strategy that’s unlikely to succeed in the long term when dealing with cognitively demanding work.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Henry Ford took radical steps to rethink how to get more out of his factory equipment. Knowledge work leaders need to take radical steps to get more out of the human brains they deploy. But this analogy need go no further. In Ford’s world, the workers were dispensable, while in the knowledge world, our brains are the source of all value. If anything, the hyperactive hive mind already has us trapped in a digital <i class="calibre5">Modern Times</i>, futilely trying to keep up with email messages that arrive faster and faster. The attention capital principle can help us move past this misery.</p>
			<h3 class="x05-head-a">When Implementing Changes, Seek Partners, Not Forgiveness</h3>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">In late 1984, Sam Carpenter, then thirty-five years old, bought a struggling telephone answering service. It had seven employees and 140 clients. It cost him $21,000. Carpenter began boldly announcing to everyone he knew that “we would someday be the highest-quality telephone answering service in the United States.” As Carpenter dryly summarizes in his 2008 book, <i class="calibre5">Work the System</i>: “Events did not unfold as anticipated.”</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">It turns out that the telephone answering service business is complicated. Clients call constantly, each representing an entirely new type of problem, from a medical emergency to an urgent business matter, each placing its own demands on the representative who takes the call. Like many small business owners, Carpenter found his life had become a “disorganized nightmare” in which he worked eighty-hour weeks, constantly putting out fires. He lost his house and car. He set up bunk beds at the office for his two teenage kids to sleep in. At one point, Carpenter was answering calls himself as the sole representative on duty during the midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift. He would then work from eight to five on the administrative minutiae generated by the business.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">None of this, of course, was sustainable. After fifteen years, Carpenter was near ruin, both physically and financially. It was then, as so often happens in these business memoirs, that he had an “earthmoving” insight. The acknowledgment that his business was in its final moments paradoxically gave Carpenter confidence to experiment with bold new approaches. It was this mindset that sparked that flash of insight: His company was like a mechanical device. It was composed of many assemblages that worked together in predictable ways. His problems, from the constant crises to the overwhelming amount of frantic administrative work drowning him, were not inevitable or the whims of circumstance, but instead the result of flaws in the underlying systems that made up his company’s operation. If he could clearly identify each of these systems, write down how it worked, then optimize it as problems arose, he could get his organization humming without issues, and without requiring his constant, hands-on-the-controls interventions.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Carpenter created a master list of all the different activities that defined his company’s operation, and began working with the relevant staff on an official system for each. One of the places he started was the company finances. He used to spend many hours each week paying bills and cashing checks, including regular trips to the bank—all of it a major source of stress. He replaced this chaos with a much more structured system for tracking expenses and revenue, and empowered his employees to make the bank trips on his behalf. What used to take hours each week was reduced to one short session during which he signed checks—a step he admits he could have also automated, but decided not to so he could maintain a more tangible understanding of his expenses. Another of these new systems streamlined customer service by providing clear guidelines that empowered employees to handle most service issues directly, without Carpenter’s involvement. The basic operating procedure for how his call center staff answered calls also became strictly codified, providing much more consistent service (with fewer performance issues for Carpenter to address), and even the process for onboarding new employees was made largely automatic, greatly reducing the complexities created by staff turnover.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">“The logic of it was crystal clear, exquisite,” he writes. “I felt a quiet joy I had never felt before. To this day, I remember every moment of it.” Carpenter’s optimism was well founded. As he worked to rebuild his company on a foundation of clear and optimized systems, profits grew for the first time. “My personal income is . . . let’s just say, more than I need,” Carpenter writes on his website. More important, his work obligations fell from eighty or more hours to less than two hours a week. By some statistical measures, the company even achieved Carpenter’s original arrogant goal, ranking number one among the more than 1,500 answering services still active in the country.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Sam Carpenter doesn’t run a knowledge work organization. We shouldn’t, therefore, pay too much attention to the details of the systems he put in place to improve the operations of his answering service. What makes him relevant to our discussion is a more general accomplishment: getting his employees to dramatically change the way they worked. The chapters that follow provide concrete ideas for how to put the attention capital principle into action by radically rethinking workflows. In most cases, the impact of these changes will extend beyond your own professional life to affect the daily experiences of other people—perhaps your employees, colleagues, or clients. This can create tricky dynamics, which is why before we move on to detailed suggestions for what to change, we should first address the question of <i class="calibre5">how</i> to make these general types of workflow modifications in a way that sticks. Carpenter’s experience can help us with this goal.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="x04-space-break-orn">—</div>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">There are two ways applying the attention capital principle can impact the people with whom you work. The first is when it alters workflows in such a way that people are forced to change how they <i class="calibre5">execute</i> their own work. This is what happened, for example, when Devesh moved his marketing company’s workflow away from email and toward project boards. His employees needed to now log in to Trello and click on the cards to communicate about a given project instead of simply sending emails.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The second type of impact changes only other people’s <i class="calibre5">expectations</i> about your own work. This applies when you focus on upgrading your personal workflow. If, for example, you now check your inbox only twice a day as part of a larger overhaul of how you work, your colleagues’ expectations for how quickly you’ll respond to their messages must shift.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">We’ll start by considering the first type of impact, as it’s trickier to deal with. It’s also the type of impact for which we can learn the most from Sam Carpenter. A key insight preached in Carpenter’s book is the need to involve those who are affected by a new work procedure in the design of that procedure. His staff wrote 98 percent of the procedures currently in place and had a “heavy hand” in shaping the remaining 2 percent that Carpenter created himself. As a result, his employees are “fully vested” in these processes. Perhaps even more crucial, Carpenter made it easy to instigate further improvements. “If an employee has a good idea for improving a procedure, we will make an instant modification—with no bureaucratic hang-ups,” he explains. He takes this employee involvement so seriously that he now requires his service representatives to submit at least a dozen proposed improvements before they qualify to receive their annual performance bonus.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Carpenter’s approach makes sense in the context of what’s known as <i class="calibre5">locus of control theory</i>, a subfield of personality psychology that argues that motivation is closely connected to whether people feel like they have control over their ultimate success in an endeavor. When you have a say in what you’re doing (placing the locus of control toward the internal end of the spectrum), you’re much more motivated than when you feel like your actions are largely controlled by outside forces (placing the locus of control toward the external end).</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This is what goes wrong if you defy Carpenter’s model and instead attempt to deploy a brand-new workflow on your team by fiat. Regardless of the workflow’s inherent benefits, you might be accidentally shifting your team’s sense of control from the internal to the external, sapping motivation and making it unlikely that they’ll stick with the changes. On the other hand, if your team members are involved in the construction of the new workflow and, equally important, feel like they’re able to improve it as deficiencies arise, then the control remains internal and the workflow is much more likely to be embraced.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This concept doesn’t apply as strongly to positions in which there are no expectations of autonomy. This is why, for example, the famously autocratic Henry Ford didn’t feel the need to involve his workers in discussions of the assembly line’s advantages and disadvantages. This also explains the success of military boot camps—the epitome of external control—in rapidly producing professional soldiers for volunteer armies: the new recruits enter the process trusting the time-tested system to get them where they need to be. As we’ve known since the forward-thinking theories of Peter Drucker, however, knowledge work will always be defined by large amounts of autonomous action. Locus of control theory therefore unavoidably applies: it simply won’t work to radically change workflows without the input of those who must use them.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">There are three steps necessary to keep these experiments collaborative. The first is education. It’s important that your team understand the difference between workflows and work execution, and why the hyperactive hive mind is just one workflow among many—and probably not a very good one. For many knowledge workers, email is synonymous with work, so it’s crucial to break up this misunderstanding before you discuss breaking up their comfortable reliance on the hive mind for getting things done.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The second step is to obtain buy-in on new workflow processes from those who will actually have to execute them. To accomplish this goal, these ideas should emerge from discussion. There should be general agreement that trying the new workflow is a worthwhile experiment, and following Carpenter’s lead, its details should be captured with crystal clear specificity so there’s no doubt about what exactly is being implemented.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The third step is to further follow Carpenter’s lead by putting in place easy methods for improving the new workflow processes when issues arise. There’s perhaps no better way to keep the locus of control internal than to empower your team to change what’s not working. In practice, you might be surprised by how few changes are actually suggested. It’s the <i class="calibre5">ability</i> to make changes that matters, as it provides a psychological emergency steam valve, neutralizing the fear that you might end up trapped in some unexpected hard edge of the new workflow, unable to get your work done.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">It’s also common for those moving past the universal accessibility of the hyperactive hive mind to put in place an emergency backup system that can handle urgent issues that the new workflow might neglect. For such a system to truly be a backup, and not just a back door that returns you to the hive mind, it must induce enough friction that you won’t use it unless the situation is sufficiently urgent. The classic example is to use phone calls as the catchall fallback: your colleagues can call your cell phone if something pops up that’s too urgent for the official workflow to reliably handle in time. These backup systems provide the peace of mind that nothing <i class="calibre5">too</i> bad can happen in the time it might take to recognize and fix flaws with new processes.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="x04-space-break-orn">—</div>
			<p class="x03-co-body-text">Let’s now turn our attention to the other type of impact to other people caused by applying the attention capital principle: changes to others’ expectations about your own behavior. As explained, this applies when you transform your personal workflow, moving your daily rhythms away from the unpredictable back-and-forth of the hyperactive hive mind. These shifts are likely to create changes that are visible to your colleagues and clients, with the most notable being that you’re no longer always answering emails or instant messages promptly. Other people will, in other words, need to shift their expectations about working with you.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">A common method for handling these personal workflow overhauls is to clearly explain the structure of your new approach to your colleagues, perhaps accompanied by an unassailably logical explanation for why you’re making these changes. A famous example of this idea in action is the following email autoresponder that Tim Ferriss cited in his 2007 mega-bestseller, <i class="calibre5">The 4-Hour Workweek</i>:</p>
			<blockquote class="calibre6">
				<p class="x06-e-mail-salutation">Greetings, Friends [or Esteemed Colleagues],</p>
				<p class="x06-e-mail">Due to high workload, I am currently checking and responding to e-mail twice daily at 12:00 P.M. ET [or your time zone] and 4:00 P.M. ET.</p>
				<p class="x06-e-mail">If you require urgent assistance (please ensure it is urgent) that cannot wait until either 12:00 P.M. or 4:00 P.M., please contact me via phone at 555-555-5555.</p>
				<p class="x06-e-mail">Thank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness. It helps me accomplish more to serve you better.</p>
				<p class="x06-e-mail">Sincerely,</p>
				<p class="x06-e-mail-closing">[Your name]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Due to the success of Ferriss’s book, there was a period of a couple of years in which tens of thousands of knowledge workers around the world began receiving some variation of the above autoresponder from their life-hacking colleagues. From a rational perspective, this strategy makes complete sense: it resets expectations so that your correspondents aren’t wondering when they’ll hear from you, and it provides a rock-solid explanation for the shift; it’s terse, it’s clear, it’s hard to argue with. This is why so many people were so excited when they first encountered it. The problem, however, is that it also turned out to be really annoying for those who received these automatic replies.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">It’s hard to put your finger on what exactly rubbed people the wrong way—perhaps the cold formality, which has a way of accidentally bleeding over into the realm of condescension, or the implication that the author of the autoresponder is trying to neutralize the receiver’s bad work habits. Whatever the specific reasons, Ferriss’s fans came to realize that this particular hack wasn’t working as well as they had hoped. Anecdotally, it seems that these autoresponders are now much rarer than they were at their peak, in the immediate aftermath of Ferriss’s book coming out. They were a good idea in the abstract but degraded under the friction of real-world application.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The lesson lurking in this case study is that care must be taken in how you publicize changes to your personal work habits. Over the years of observing many different attempts by individuals to push back against or change their dependence on the hyperactive hive mind, and having attempted more than a few such changes myself, I’ve come to believe that these experiments are best executed quietly. Don’t share the details of your new approach to work, unless someone specifically asks you out of genuine interest. Be wary of even providing new expectations, such as “I generally don’t see email until after 10:00 a.m.” or “I check my inbox only a few times a day.” These provide hard edges that skeptical colleagues, clients, or bosses can begin to easily chip away. (“What if I need something urgently from you earlier? No . . . I don’t like this at all—I think you need to stay better on top of your messages.”) Similarly, if you get in the habit of asking for forgiveness—as is often suggested—people around you will get in the habit of thinking your work strategies must be broken, because why else would they keep causing you to apologize?</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">A better strategy for shifting others’ expectations about your work is to consistently deliver what you promise instead of consistently explaining how you’re working. Become known as someone who never drops the ball, not someone who thinks a lot about their own productivity. If a request comes your way, be it in an email or hallway chat, make sure it’s handled. Don’t let things fall through the cracks, and if you commit to doing something by a certain time, hit the deadline, or explain why you need to shift it. If people trust you to handle the work they send your way, then they’re generally fine with not hearing back from you right away. On the other hand, if you’re flaky, others will demand faster responses, as they’ll feel they have to stay on you to ensure things get done. The professor and business writer Adam Grant uses the phrase “idiosyncrasy credits” to describe this reality. The better you are at what you do, he explains, the more freedom you earn to be idiosyncratic in how you deliver—no explanation required.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">Another issue that comes from transforming your personal workflow concerns system interfaces. If you put in place the types of advanced workflow systems discussed in the upcoming chapters, you’ll have to figure out how you want other people, who are used to just grabbing your attention with a quick message, to interact with these more structured alternatives.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">For guidance in this matter, we can learn from the world of IT support. As discussed earlier in the book, a couple of decades ago, IT support staff began internally organizing the technology issues they were tasked with fixing using so-called ticketing systems. These systems assign each problem a single <i class="calibre5">ticket.</i> All conversations and notes about the problem are attached to its ticket, where they can be easily reviewed.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">IT professionals quickly realized the futility in requiring those they served to interface directly with the ticketing system; for example, by having them log in to a special support site to create and track these tickets. This might be the most efficient way to handle these issues in the abstract, but the concrete reality of many organizations is that most people wouldn’t put up with the extra overhead. The solution to this issue was to create a <i class="calibre5">seamless interface.</i> In most IT setups, you now submit a problem in the most natural possible manner: by sending an email to a general-purpose address like support@companyname.com. Most ticketing systems can be configured to receive these emails directly, then transform them into tickets and place them in a virtual inbox to be processed. As the IT staff works on a ticket, the system can then send automatic updates, as email messages, back to the originator of the issue. The person interacting with IT doesn’t have to know anything about ticketing systems. They simply send an email and receive email updates back in response. Internally, however, something much more structured is unfolding.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">This lesson applies to the systems you put in place to organize your personal workflows. Don’t require the people you work with to learn about your new systems or change the way they interact with you. Instead, when possible, deploy a seamless interface. We can use my own recent experience as a professor to help elaborate this approach. During the year in which I’m writing the bulk of this manuscript, I’m taking a turn as the director of graduate studies for the computer science department at Georgetown. One of the responsibilities of this role is to head the graduate committee, which oversees our graduate program, including approving changes and answering requests about policy.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">As you might imagine, this leads to a large number of incoming issues that I’m in charge of resolving. Taking a page out of Devesh’s playbook, I internally deploy a Trello board to help make sense of these requests. My board has the following columns:</p>
			<ul class="calibre7">
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted-first">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <i class="calibre5">waiting to deal with</i></p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <i class="calibre5">waiting to deal with (time sensitive)</i></p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <i class="calibre5">to discuss at next graduate committee meeting</i></p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <i class="calibre5">to discuss at next meeting with department chair</i></p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <i class="calibre5">waiting to hear back from someone</i></p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-list-bulleted-last">
					<p class="x07-list-bulleted-first1">☐ <i class="calibre5">working on this week</i></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-body-text">When someone sends me an email or stops by my office with an issue concerning the graduate program, I immediately transform it into a card and place it in the applicable column on the Trello board.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">At the beginning of each week, I review this board and move cards around as appropriate: deciding, for example, what I want to work on this week, or what needs to be discussed in upcoming meetings. I can also follow up on issues I’m waiting to hear back from someone about. My general rule is that when I move a card to a new column, I send an email update to the person who brought me that issue. For example, if I move something from a <i class="calibre5">waiting</i> column to the <i class="calibre5">discuss at next graduate committee meeting</i> column, I’ll send a note to the appropriate person telling them that we’ll be discussing their issue soon. If I take a card off the board because I completed the corresponding task, I’ll let the relevant people know the ultimate resolution. And so on.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The key property of this system is that the professors and graduate students in my department know nothing about it. I suppose I could try to insist that they all log in to my Trello board to enter new issues or check on the status of old issues. In theory, this might save me a few extra messages, but in reality, no one would actually do this—and I can’t blame them! It takes me about thirty minutes, once a week, to process my board and send update messages. I receive massive benefits from structuring all these issues so clearly, and because I spent a little extra time to make my interface seamless, my colleagues can enjoy these benefits as well.</p>

			<p class="x03-co-body-text">At first encounter, my advice for applying the attention capital principle to groups seems at odds with my advice for applying the principle to individuals. The former emphasizes the need for clear communication about the workflows replacing the hyperactive hive mind, while the latter suggests you keep these changes largely private. A closer look, however, reveals that both approaches are based on the same principle: people don’t like changes they can’t control.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">When modifying the workflow of an entire team or organization, everyone can be involved in this change and feel empowered to optimize it. As discussed earlier, this provides a sense that the locus of control is internal, motivating people to stick with the changes. When you alter your personal workflow, by contrast, those you work with didn’t really have a say in what you decided to do. If they’re then presented with a new system that will impact their own work, but for which they had no input, the locus of control moves toward the external, creating irritation and a tendency to try to push back and reassert some control. They don’t applaud your clever new autoresponder; they instead find ways to tear down the restrictions it has imposed on them.</p>
			<p class="x04-body-text">The psychology at play here is perhaps a bit subtle, but also crucial to master if you hope to succeed in maximizing your attention capital. Work is not just about getting things done; it’s a collection of messy human personalities trying to figure out how to successfully collaborate. The three chapters that follow look closely at specific strategies for replacing the hyperactive hive mind with much more effective workflows. The value of these detailed approaches, however, will be greatly diminished if you don’t first master the subtle art of putting them into action in a way that sticks.</p>
